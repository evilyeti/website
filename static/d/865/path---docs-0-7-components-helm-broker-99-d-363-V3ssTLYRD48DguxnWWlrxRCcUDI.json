A Service Broker manages the lifecycle of one or more services. It advertises a catalog of service offerings and service plans to a platform.\n\nThe Service Catalog lists all services that the Service Brokers offer. Use the Service Brokers to:\n* Provision and de-provision an instance of a service\n* Create and delete a service binding\n\nCreate a service binding to link a service instance to an application. During this process, credentials are delivered in Secrets to provide you with the information necessary to connect to the service instance. The process of deleting a service binding is known as unbinding.\n\nEach of the Service Brokers available in Kyma performs these operations in a different way. See the documentation for a given Service Broker to learn how it operates.\n\nKyma provides these Service Brokers to use with the Service Catalog:\n\n* Azure Service Broker\n* Google Cloud Platform Service Broker (Experimental)\n* Application Broker\n* Helm Broker\n\nFollow the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md) specification to build your own Service Broker.\nRegister every new Service Broker in the Service Catalog to make the services and plans available to the users.

A bundle is an abstraction layer over a Helm chart which allows you to represent it as a ClusterServiceClass in the Service Catalog. For example, a bundle can provide plan definitions or binding details. The Helm Broker fetches bundle definitions from an HTTP server. By default, the Helm Broker fetches bundles from the newest release with the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) pattern available at the [`bundles`](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/releases) repository.\n\nUsing bundles, you can also install other brokers, such as the [Google Cloud Platform Service Broker](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/tree/master/bundles/gcp-service-broker-0.0.2).\n\nFor more information about the Service Brokers, see [this](#overview-service-brokers) document.\n\nThe Helm Broker implements the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/profile.md#service-metadata) (OSB API).\nTo be compliant with the Service Catalog version used in Kyma, the Helm Broker supports only the following versions of the OSB API:\n- v2.13\n- v2.12\n- v2.11\n\n> **NOTE:** The Helm Broker does not implement the OSB API update operation.\n","type":"Overview"},{"order":"01-04-azure-broker","title":"Azure Broker","source":"\nThe Microsoft Azure Service Broker is an open source, [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/)-compatible API server that provisions managed services in the Microsoft Azure public cloud.

The Helm Broker fetches bundles from the remote HTTP server.\n2. The Helm Broker registers bundles as ServiceClasses in the Service Catalog.\n\n![Helm Broker registration](./assets/010-helm-registration.png)\n\n### Bundles provisioning and binding\n\nAfter the registration, the process of bundle provisioning and binding takes place. It consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Select a given bundle ServiceClass from the Service Catalog.\n2. Provision this ServiceClass by creating its ServiceInstance in the given Namespace.\n3. Bind your ServiceInstance to the service or lambda. During the binding process, ServiceBinding and ServiceBindingUsage resources are created.\n4.

The **config.repository.URL** attribute defines the HTTP server URL.\n\n### Configuring the Helm Broker externally\n\nFollow these steps to change the configuration and make the Helm Broker fetch bundles from a custom HTTP server:\n\n1. Create a remote bundles repository. Your remote bundle repository must include the following resources:\n    - A `yaml` file which defines available bundles, for example `bundles.yaml`.\n      This file must have the following structure:\n\n      ```text\n      apiVersion: v1\n      entries:\n        {bundle_name}:\n          - name: {bundle_name}\n            description: {bundle_description}\n            version: {bundle_version}\n      ```\n      This is an example of a `yaml` file for the Redis bundle:\n      ```text\n      apiVersion: v1\n      entries:\n        redis:\n          - name: redis\n            description: Redis service\n            version: 0.0.1\n      ```\n\n    - A `{bundle_name}-{bundle_version}.tgz` file for each bundle version defined in the `yaml` file. The `.tgz` file is an archive of your bundle's directory.\n\n2. In the `values.yaml` provide your server's URLs in the **repository.URLs** attribute as a list of URLs separated by a semicolon:\n\n  ```yaml\n    repository:\n      URLs: \"http://custom.bundles-repository/bundles.yaml;http://another.bundles-repository/bundles.yaml\"\n  ```\n  > **NOTE:** You can skip the `yaml` filename in the URL if the name of the file is `index.yaml`. In that case, your URL should be equal to `http://custom.bundles-repository/`.\n\n3. Install Kyma on Minikube. See [this](/docs/0.7/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-the-release) document to learn how.\n\n### Configure repository URLs in the runtime\n\nFollow these steps to add the repository URL:\n\n1. Add a new bundle repository URL:\n\n ```bash\n URLS=$(kubectl get -n kyma-system deployment/helm-broker --output=jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name==\"APP_REPOSITORY_URLS\")].value}')\n \n kubectl set env -n kyma-system deployment/helm-broker -e APP_REPOSITORY_URLS=\"$URLS;http://custom.bundles-repository/bundles.yaml\"\n \n # At the moment, there is a bug in Minikube. As a result, for the local installation you need to manually edit the broker and bump the relistRequests attribute.\n \n kubectl edit clusterservicebrokers helm-broker\n ```\n\n2. Wait for the Helm Broker to run using the following command:\n\n ```bash\n kubectl get pod -n kyma-system -l app=helm-broker\n ```\n\nRunning the Helm Broker triggers the Service Catalog synchronization automatically. New ClusterServiceClasses appear after a half-minute.\n","type":"Configuration"},{"order":"05-02-helm-broker-bundles","title":"How to create a bundle","source":"\n[bind]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#binding  \"OSB Spec Binding\"\n[service-objects]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#service-object \"OSB Spec Service Objects\"\n[service-metadata]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/profile.md#service-metadata \"OSB Spec Service Metadata\"\n[plan-objects]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#plan-object \"OSB Spec Plan Objects\"\n\nTo create your own bundle, you must create a directory with the following structure:\n\n```\nsample-bundle/\n  ├── meta.yaml                             # A file which contains the metadata information about this bundle\n  ├── chart/                                # A directory which contains a Helm chart that installs your Kubernetes resources\n  │    └── <chart-name>/                    # A Helm chart directory\n  │         └── ....                        # Helm chart files\n  └── plans/                                # A directory which contains the possible plans for an installed chart\n       ├── example-enterprise               # A directory of files for a specific plan\n       │   ├── meta.yaml                    # A file which contains the metadata information about this plan\n       │   ├── bind.yaml                    # A file which contains information about the values that the Helm Broker returns when it receives the bind request\n       │   ├── create-instance-schema.json  # The JSON Schema definitions for creating a ServiceInstance\n       │   ├── bind-instance-schema.json    # The JSON Schema definitions for binding a ServiceInstance\n       │   ├── update-instance-schema.json  # The JSON Schema definitions for updating a ServiceInstance\n       │   └── values.yaml                  # The default configuration values in this plan for a chart defined in the `chart` directory\n       └── ....\n```\n\n> **NOTE:** All the file names in the bundle directory are case-sensitive.\n\n\n### The bundle meta.yaml file\n\nThe `meta.yaml` file is mandatory as it contains information about the bundle.

The Helm Broker always adds the `local:true` label and it adds the `provisionOnlyOnce:true` label only if **provisionOnlyOnce** is set to `true`. \n\n### The chart directory\n\nIn the mandatory `chart` directory, create a folder with the same name as your chart. Put all the files related to your chart in this folder. The system supports chart version 2.6.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the chart definitions, see the [Charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.6/docs/charts.md) specification.\n\n> **NOTE:** Helm Broker uses the [helm wait](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.6/docs/using_helm.md#helpful-options-for-installupgraderollback) option to ensure that all the resources that a chart creates are available. If you set your Deployment **replicas** to `1`, you must set **maxUnavailable** to `0` as a part of the rolling update strategy.\n\n### The plans directory\n\nThe mandatory `plans` directory must contain at least one plan.\nA directory for a specific plan must contain the `meta.yaml` file. Other files, such as `create-instance-schema.json`, `bind.yaml` and `values.yaml` are not mandatory.\n\n#### The meta.yaml file\n\nThe `meta.yaml` file contains information about a bundle plan. Set the following fields to create the plan objects, which comply with the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects].\n\n|  Field Name | Required |                                             Description                                                    |\n|:-----------:|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|     **name**    |   true   |     The plan name.

It has the same restrictions as defined in the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects].    |\n|     **free**    |   false  | The attribute which specifies whether the instance is free or not. The default value is `false`.    |\n\n#### The bind.yaml file\n\nThe `bind.yaml` file contains the information required for the [binding action][bind] in a specific plan.\nIf you defined in the `meta.yaml` file that your plan is bindable, you must also create a `bind.yaml` file.\nFor more information about the content of the `bind.yaml` file, see the [Binding bundles](#configuration-binding-bundles) document.\n\n#### The values.yaml file\n\nThe `values.yaml` file provides the default configuration values in a concrete plan for the chart definition located in the `chart` directory.\nThis file is not required.\nFor more information about the content of the `values.yaml` file, see the [Values Files](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.6/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files.md) specification.\n\n#### The create-instance-schema.json file\n\nThe `create-instance-schema.json` file contains a schema used to define the parameters for a provision operation of the ServiceInstance. Each input parameter is expressed as a property within a JSON object.\nThis file is not required.\nFor more information about the content of the `create-instance-schema.json` file, see the [Schemas](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#schemas-object) specification.\n\n#### The update-instance-schema.json file\n\nThe `update-instance-schema.json` file contains a schema used to define the parameters for an update operation of the ServiceInstance. Each input parameter is expressed as a property within a JSON object.\nThis file is not required.\nFor more information about the content of the `update-instance-schema.json` file, see the [Schemas](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#schemas-object) specification.\n\n#### The bind-instance-schema.json file\n\nThe `bind-instance-schema.json` file contains a schema used to define the parameters for a bind operation. Each input parameter is expressed as a property within a JSON object.\nThis file is not required.\nFor more information about the content of the `bind-instance-schema.json` file, see the [Schemas](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#schemas-object) specification.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nUse the dry-run mode to check the generated manifests of the chart without installing it.\nThe **--debug** option prints the generated manifests.\nAs a prerequisite, you must install [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) on your machine to run this command:\n\n```\n helm install --dry-run {path-to-chart} --debug\n```\nFor more details, read the Helm [official documentation](https://docs.helm.sh/chart_template_guide/#debugging-templates).\n","type":"Configuration"},{"order":"05-03-helm-broker-bundles-binding","title":"Binding bundles","source":"\n\n[bind]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.12/spec.md#binding  \"OSB Spec Binding\"\n\nIf you defined in the `meta.yaml` file that your plan is bindable, you must also create a `bind.yaml` file.\nThe `bind.yaml` file supports the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) binding concept. The `bind.yaml` file contains information the system uses in the [binding process][bind].\nThe `bind.yaml` file is mandatory for all bindable plans. Currently, Kyma supports only the [credentials](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#types-of-binding)-type binding.   \n\n\n>**NOTE:** Resolving the values from the `bind.yaml` file is a post-provision action. If this operation ends with an error, the provisioning also fails.\n\n## Details\n\nThis section provides an example of the `bind.yaml` file. It further describes the templating, the policy concerning credential name conflicts, and the detailed `bind.yaml` file specification.\n\n### Example usage\n\n```yaml\n# bind.yaml\ncredential:\n  - name: HOST\n    value: redis.svc.cluster.local\n  - name: PORT\n    valueFrom:\n      serviceRef:\n        name: redis-svc\n        jsonpath: '{ .spec.ports[?(@.name==\"redis\")].port }'\n  - name: REDIS_PASSWORD\n    valueFrom:\n      secretKeyRef:\n        name: redis-secrets\n        key: redis-password\n\ncredentialFrom:\n  - configMapRef:\n    name: redis-config\n  - secretRef:\n    name: redis-v2-secrets\n```\n\nIn this example of the [binding action][bind], the Helm Broker returns the following values:\n- A `HOST` key with the defined inlined value.\n- A `PORT` key with the value from the field specified by the JSONPath expressions. The `redis-svc` Service runs this expression.\n- A `REDIS_PASSWORD` key with a value selected by the `redis-password` key from the `redis-secrets` Secret.\n- All the key-value pairs fetched from the `redis-config` ConfigMap.\n- All the key-value pairs fetched from the `redis-v2-secrets` Secrets.\n\n### Templating\n\nIn the `bind.yaml` file, you can use the Helm Chart templates directives.\n\n```yaml\n# bind.yaml\ncredential:\n  - name: HOST\n    value: {{ template \"redis.fullname\" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local\n{{- if .Values.usePassword }}\n  - name: REDIS_PASSWORD\n    valueFrom:\n      secretKeyRef:\n        name: {{ template \"redis.fullname\" . }}\n        key: redis-password\n{{- end }}\n```\nIn this example, the system renders the `bind.yaml` file. The system resolves all the directives enclosed in the double curly braces in the same way as in the files located in the `templates` directory in your Helm chart.\n\n### Credential name conflicts policy\n\nThe following rules apply in cases of credential name conflicts:\n- When the `credential` and the `credentialFrom` sections have duplicate values, the system uses the values from the `credential` section.\n- When you duplicate a key in the `credential` section, an error appears and informs you about the name of the key that the conflict refers to.\n- When a key exists in the multiple sources defined by the `credentialFrom` section, the value associated with the last source takes precedence.\n\n### File specification\n\n|   Field Name   |                                                                                                                              Description                                                                                                                              |\n|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|   [credential](#configuration-binding-bundles-credential)   |                                                                                                         The list of the credential variables to return during the binding action.                                                                                                        |\n| [credentialFrom](#configuration-binding-bundles-credentialfrom) | The list of the sources to populate the credential variables on the binding action.

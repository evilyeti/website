Our main focus is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To meet you, show you what Kyma is, and answer all your questions</li>\n<li>Meet with other communities. For now, we are planning to meet with the Kubernetes' Testing SIG and the Service Catalog SIG and talk about our future contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These Kyma experts are comming:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ralf Hofmann, our Product Lead</li>\n<li>Krassimir Semerdzhiev, our Strategist </li>\n<li>Ahmed Abdalla, <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core\">the leader of the Kyma's Core SIG</a> and our Engineering Lead</li>\n<li>Piotr Kopczynski, <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core\">the leader of the Kyma's Core SIG</a> and the owner of the Kyma's Service Catalog capability</li>\n<li>Lukasz Gornicki, <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core\">the leader of the Kyma's Core SIG</a> and the owner of the Kyma's Core and Supporting capability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The easiest way to talk to us before the event is to do it through <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/kyma-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAwNzE4Mjk2NDE3LTJhOTlmZjM5YzkwNmEzNmY3ZjE2MTU2OTMxOGE4ZDM0MmU4ZWRkZGJiODgzNmRmMTYxMDYwNjZiMDAwMTA2OWM\">Slack</a>.\nDuring the event, you can easily find all Kyma members that travel to Seattle at the SAP booth. Why SAP? Kyma was donated to the open-source community a few months ago by <a href=\"https://kyma-project.io/blog/introducing-project-kyma\">SAP</a>. Therefore, at the moment it is much easier for us to be there at the SAP booth together with another great Kubernetes-native project called <a href=\"https://gardener.cloud/\">Gardener</a>.</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for? <a href=\"https://kyma-project.io/docs/root/kyma#installation-installation\">Install Kyma now</a> and prepare your questions.</p>\n<p>See you there and follow us for any updates on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kymaproject\">Twitter</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 03, 2018","path":"/blog/kyma-at-kubecon","title":"Kyma at KubeCon","author":"Lukasz Gornicki, Product Owner @Kyma","tags":["cncf","kubecon","conference"]}}},"pageContext":{}}

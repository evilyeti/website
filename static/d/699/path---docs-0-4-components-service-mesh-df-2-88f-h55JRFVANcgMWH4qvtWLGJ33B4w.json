Kyma Service Mesh\nis based on [Istio](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html) open platform. The main principle of Kyma Service Mesh operation is the process of injecting Pods of every service with an Envoy - a sidecar proxy which intercepts the communication between the services and regulates it by applying and enforcing the rules you create. Kyma [Dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex), which is also a part of the Service Mesh, allows you to integrate any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)-compliant identity provider or a SAML2-based enterprise authentication server with your solution.\n\nSee this [Istio diagram](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/arch.svg) to understand the relationship between the Istio components and Services.\n"},{"order":"005-details-sidecar-proxy-injection","title":"Sidecar Proxy Injection","source":"\nBy default, the Istio Sidecar Injector watches all Pod creation operations on all Namespaces but it does not inject the newly created Pods with a sidecar proxy.\n\nTo enable the sidecar proxy injection, set the **istio-injection** label value to `enabled` for the Namespace in which you want to enable the sidecar proxy injection. Use this command:\n\n```\nkubectl label namespace {YOUR_NAMESPACE} istio-injection=enabled\n```\n\nWith the sidecar proxy injection enabled, you can inject the sidecar to Pods of a selected deployment in the given Namespace. Add this annotation to the deployment configuration file:\n```\nsidecar.istio.io/inject: \"true\"\n```\n\nRead the [Installing the Istio Sidecar](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection.html) document to learn more about sidecar proxy

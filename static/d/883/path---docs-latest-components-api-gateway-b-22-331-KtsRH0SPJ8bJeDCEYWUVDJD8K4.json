Creating a valid CR triggers the API Controller to create an Istio Virtual Service. Optionally, you can specify the **authentication** attribute of the CR to secure the exposed service and create an Istio Authentication Policy for it.\n"},{"order":"02-01-api-gateway","title":"Architecture","source":"\nThis diagram illustrates the workflow that leads to exposing a service in Kyma:\n\n![service-exposure-flow](./assets/001-service-exposure-flow.png)\n\n- **API Controller** is a component responsible for exposing services. The API Controller is an application deployed in the `kyma-system` Namespace, implemented according to the [Kubernetes Operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html) principles. The API Controller listens for newly created custom resources (CR) that follow the set `api.gateway.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), which describes the details of exposing services in Kyma.\n\n- **Istio Virtual Service** is used to specify the services that are visible outside the cluster. The API Controller creates a Virtual Service for the hostname defined in the `api.gateway.kyma-project.io` CRD. The convention is to create a hostname using the name of the service as the subdomain, and the domain of the Kyma cluster. To learn more about the Istio Virtual Service concept, read this [Istio documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).\nTo get the list of Virtual Services in Kyma, run:\n```\nkubectl get virtualservices.networking.istio.io --all-namespaces\n```\n\n- **Istio Authentication Policy** allows operators to specify authentication requirements for a service. It is an optional resource, created only when the CR specifies the desired authentication method, the token issuer, and the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint URI. You can secure services using the `JWT` authentication method. You can specify multiple JWT issuers to allow to access the service with tokens from different ID providers. For more details, see [this](#details-security) document. The JWKS endpoint is used to fetch cryptographic keys, which allow to verify the ID token signature. Services exposed through a CR with the **authentication** section specified require valid ID tokens to access them. To learn more about the Istio Authentication Policy, read this [Istio security documentation](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/security/authn-policy/).\nTo get the list of Istio Authentication Policies created in Kyma, run:\n```\nkubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io --all-namespaces\n```\n"},{"order":"03-01-security","title":"Security","source":"\nWhen you expose a service in Kyma, you can secure it by specifying the **authentication** attribute in the custom resource (CR). To successfully secure the exposed service, its Pods must have the Istio sidecar injection enabled. Additionally, you must specify all of these attributes in the CR:\n  - **authentication.type**\n  - **jwt.issuer**\n  - **jwt.jwksUri**\n\nIf you don't specify any of these attributes, the API Controller doesn't create an Istio Authentication Policy for the service and leaves it unsecured.\n\n>**NOTE:** You can secure only the entire service. You cannot secure the specific endpoints of the service.\n\n## Call a secured service\n\nYou can secure the exposed service using JWT authentication. This means that you must include a valid JWT ID token in the `Authorization` header of the request when you call\na secured service.\n\nThis is an example of a call to a secure exposed service:\n```\ncurl -i https://httpbin.org/headers -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFmNThlNTBhODI4OWMzYWM5MmE5ZTA2ZmM0YzIyZDc1NTU4MTc5YjIifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2RleC55ZmFjdG9yeS5zYXAuY29ycCIsInN1YiI6IkNpUXhPR0U0TmpnMFlpMWtZamc0TFRSaU56TXRPVEJoT1MwelkyUXhOall4WmpVME5qTVNCV3h2WTJGcyIsImF1ZCI6WyJreW1hLWNsaWVudCIsImt1YmVjb250cm9sbGVyIl0sImV4cCI6MTUzMDA5ODg3MiwiaWF0IjoxNTMwMDEyNDcyLCJhenAiOiJrdWJlY29udHJvbGxlciIsImF0X2hhc2giOiJ5QzJwY0ZmVWYzWVd2N2U5QUY3U0t3IiwiZW1haWwiOiJhZG1pbkBreW1hLmN4IiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWUsIm5hbWUiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.pxy4P95PVSwIiXArcfsqAPVFhBmo5sHzUnqzwY6HF9UgMRkDFlIs5CKe1ZiGteGr6-gYU_0VmHroZ4alpcVcpL8Z5M2xnlOaZDyB8TNLvUAATpElcBMy6Cxb_7zLwP91IsX0QgI3DTg3H-M0eaJ4VwMKrfEu9h2rwxzvBrDc5vB_1Bm8OABl08wLSQpR27GGsI58RmA5YJmZX1PSzv90Zl_krqyvWIe6pmcHCrP--02LLUaoxhY42IDWkF8n9RPMLixmFZFXbeonCddR30OUkAbEFLBVBf8nJaFDms_VjZHSXZDitCu4r6myE4AnT_IeXI2dRgdGT73Hh8895zu7fQ\"\n```\n## Specify multiple JWT token issuers\n\nYou can specify multiple JWT token issuers to allow to access the secured service with tokens issued by different ID providers. You can successfully call the secured service using JWT ID tokens issued by any of the parties specified in the **authentication** attribute of the CR. This is an example of the **authentication** attribute that allows to access the service using JWT tokens signed by two different issuers.\n\n```\n    - type: JWT\n      jwt:\n        issuer: https://sampleissuer1.abc.com\n        jwksUri: https://www.sampleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs\n    - type: JWT\n      jwt:\n        issuer: https://sampleissuer2.abc.com\n        jwksUri: https://www.regularsampleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs\n```\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"06-01-api","title":"Api","source":"\nThe `api.gateway.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format the API Controller listens for.

Logspout is a log router for Docker containers that runs inside Docker. It attaches to each container on a host and routes their logs to a Log Management System. OK Log is a distributed coordination-free log management system. It is a lightweight solution which is not only easy to understand but also easy to operate."},{"order":"02-01-logging","title":"Architecture","source":"\nThis document outlines the logging architecture of Kyma. It highlights information sources from which Logspout extracts logs to feed to OK Log.\n\nLogspout is deployed as a stateless Daemonset and shares `/var/run/docker.sock` from the node. It then feeds the logs to OK Log through the ingest API.\n\nOK Log is deployed as a Statefulset. It is capable for storing the logs for 7 days, which is a configurable property. Read more on OK Log architectural decisions [here](https://github.com/oklog/oklog/tree/master/doc/arch).\n"},{"order":"03-01-access-oklog","title":"Access OK Log","source":"\nTo access the OK Log UI, follow these steps:\n\n1. Run the following command to configure port forwarding:\n\n```\nkubectl port-forward -n kyma-system svc/logging-oklog 7650:7650\n```\n\n2. Access the OK Log UI at `http://localhost:7650/ui`.\n\n3. Use a plaintext or regular expression to pull up logs from OK Log. For example, `pod.name:core-kubeless`.\n","type":"Details"}]},"navigation":{"topics":[{"id":"kyma","contentType":"root","sections":[{"topicType":"Overview","name":"Overview","anchor":"overview","titles":[{"name":"In

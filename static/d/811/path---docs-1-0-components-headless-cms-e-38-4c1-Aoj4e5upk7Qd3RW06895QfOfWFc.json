It allows you to pull the content into your own application and tailor it to your needs, delivering it in any format, on any device. Contrary to the traditional CMS, such as WordPress, the Headless CMS does not provide a display layer and ready-to-use templates. Instead, it only ensures a database backend. It gives flexibility on the choice of the frontend, thus cutting the default \"head\" off the traditional CMS solutions.\n\n## Headless CMS in Kyma\n\nKyma provides a Kubernetes-based solution that relies on the custom resource (CR) extensibility feature and the [Asset Store](/docs/1.0/components/asset-store/#overview-overview) as a backend mechanism. The Headless CMS in Kyma allows you to upload multiple and grouped data for a given documentation topic and store them as Asset CRs in Minio buckets. All you need to do is to specify all topic details, such as documentation sources, in a DocsTopic CR or a ClusterDocsTopic CR and apply it to a given Namespace or a cluster. The CR supports various documentation formats, including images, Markdown documents, [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), [OData](https://www.odata.org/), and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification files. You can upload them as single (direct file URLs) and packed assets (ZIP or TAR).\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe Headless CMS brings a number of benefits:\n\n- It provides a unified way of uploading different document types to a Kyma cluster.\n- It fits into the Kyma modularity concept as you load onto a cluster only documentation for the installed components. This is possible as the DocsTopic CR and the code for a given component are located in the same place in the `kyma` repository.\n- It supports baked-in documentation. Apart from the default documentation, you can add your own and group it as you like, the same way you use micro frontends to personalize views in the Console UI. For example, you can add contextual help for a given Service Broker in the Service Catalog.\n"},{"order":"02-01-headless-cms","title":"Architecture","source":"\n## Resources\n\nThe Headless CMS in Kyma consists of these components:\n\n- **DocsTopic custom resource** (CR) orchestrates the creation of multiple Asset CRs for a specific documentation topic in a given Namespace. It has a cluster-wide counterpart called **ClusterDocsTopic CR**.\n\n- **DocsTopic Controller** creates Asset custom resources (CRs) based on the DocsTopic CR definition. If the DocsTopic CR defines two sources of documentation topics, such as `asyncapi` and `markdown`, the DocsTopic Controller creates two Asset CRs.\nThe DocsTopic Controller also monitors the status of the Asset CR and updates the status of the DocsTopic CR accordingly.\n\n## Headless CMS flow\n\nSee the diagram for an overview of the basic Headless CMS workflow.\n\n>**NOTE:** This flow also applies to the ClusterDocsTopic CR.\n\n![](./assets/headless-cms-architecture.svg)\n\n1. The Kyma user creates a DocsTopic CR in a given Namespace.\n2. The DocsTopic Controller reads the DocsTopic CR definition.\n3. The DocsTopic Controller checks if the [Bucket CR](/docs/1.0/components/asset-store/#details-bucket-custom-resource-lifecycle) already exists in this Namespace. If it does not exist yet, the DocsTopic Controller creates a new Bucket CR with the `cms-public-{suffix}` name, where `{suffix}` is a randomly generated string.\n4. The DocsTopic Controller creates Asset CRs in the number corresponding to the number of sources specified in the DocsTopic CR. It adds **cms.kyma-project.io/type** and **cms.kyma-project.io/docs-topic** labels to every Asset CR definition. It also adds the bucket name under the **bucketRef** field to every Asset CR definition.\n5. The DocsTopic Controller verifies if the Asset CRs are in the `Ready` phase and updates the status of the DocsTopic CR accordingly.\n"},{"order":"03-01-headless-cms-in-console","title":"Headless CMS in the Console","source":"\nHeadless CMS in Kyma is a separate component and does not provide templates or a standalone UI to display content from the CMS. Still, the Console UI displays some of the assets in the Docs view (generic and component-related documentation) and the Service Catalog views (API specifications).\n\nAdd a new documentation topic to the Console UI by creating a CR, while the [Asset Store](/docs/1.0/components/asset-store/#overview-overview) handles the rest. Define the location, grouping, and order of the documents through DocsTopic and ClusterDocsTopic labels that you add to the custom resource definition. You can create your own labels and follow your own naming convention, but **cms.kyma-project.io/{label-name}** applies to the Console UI.\n\nUse these labels to mark and filter assets in the Console UI:\n\n- **cms.kyma-project.io/view-context** specifies the location in the Console UI to render the given asset. This can be either `docs-ui` or `service-catalog`.\n- **cms.kyma-project.io/group-name** defines the group, such as `components`, under which you want to render the given asset under the `docs-ui` view in the Console UI. The value cannot include spaces.\n- **cms.kyma-project.io/order** specifies the position of the DocsTopic and ClusterDocsTopic in relation to other DocsTopics under the `docs-ui` view in the Console UI. For example, this can be `4`.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-02-docstopic-cr-lifecycle","title":"DocsTopic custom resource lifecycle","source":"\n>**NOTE:** This lifecycle also applies to the ClusterDocsTopic CR.\n\n## Asset CR manual changes\n\nThe DocsTopic custom resource (CR) coordinates Asset CR creation, deletion, and modifications. The DocsTopic Controller verifies DocsTopic definition on a regular basis and creates, deletes, or modifies Assets CRs accordingly.\n\nThe DocsTopic CR acts as the only source of truth for the Asset CRs it orchestrates. If you modify or remove any of them manually, DocsTopic Controller automatically overwrites such an Asset CR or updates it based on the DocsTopic CR definition.\n\n##  DocsTopic CR and Asset CR dependencies\n\nAsset CRs and DocsTopic CRs are also interdependent in terms of names, definitions, and statuses.\n\n### Names\n\nThe name of every Asset CR created by the DocsTopic Controller consists of these three elements:\n\n- The name of the DocsTopic CR, such as `service-catalog`.\n- The source type of the given asset in the DocsTopic CR, such as `asyncapi`.\n- A randomly generated string, such as `1b38grj5vcu1l`.\n\nThe full name of such an Asset CR that follows the **{docsTopic-name}-{asset-source}-{suffix}** pattern is **service-catalog-asyncapi-1b38grj5vcu1l**.\n\n### Labels\n\nThere are two labels in every Asset CR created from DocsTopic CRs. Both of them are based on DocsTopic CRs definitions:\n\n- **cms.kyma-project.io/type** equals a given **type** parameter from the DocsTopic CR, such as `asyncapi`.\n\n- **cms.kyma-project.io/docs-topic** equals the **name** metadata from the DocsTopic CR, such as `service-catalog`.\n\n### Statuses\n\nThe status of the DocsTopic CR depends heavily on the status phase of all Asset CRs it creates. It is:\n\n- `Ready` when all related Asset CRs are already in the `Ready` phase.\n- `Pending` when it awaits the confirmation that all related Asset CRs are in the `Ready` phase. If any Asset CR is in the `Failed` phase, the status of the DocsTopic CR remains `Pending`.\n- `Failed` when processing of the DocsTopic CR fails. For example, the DocsTopic CR can fail if you provide incorrect or duplicated data in its specification.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"06-01-docstopic","title":"DocsTopic","source":"\nThe `docstopics.cms.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to define an orchestrator that creates Asset CRs for a specific asset type.

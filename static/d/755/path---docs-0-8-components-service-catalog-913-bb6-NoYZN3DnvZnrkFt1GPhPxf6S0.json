Its purpose is to provide an easy way for Kyma users to access services that the Service Brokers manage and use them in their applications.\n\nDue to the fact that Kyma runs on Kubernetes, you can easily instantiate a service that a third party provides and maintains, such as a database. You can consume it from Kyma without extensive knowledge about the clustering of such a datastore service and the responsibility for its upgrades and maintenance. You can also easily provision an instance of the software offering that a Service Broker registered in Kyma exposes, and bind it to an application running in the Kyma cluster.\n\nYou can perform the following operations in the Service Catalog:\n\n- Expose the consumable services by listing them with all the details, including the documentation and the consumption plans.\n- Consume the services by provisioning them in a given Namespace.\n- Bind the services to the applications through Secrets.\n"},{"order":"02-01-architecture-service-catalog","title":"Architecture","source":"\nThe diagram and steps describe the Service Catalog workflow and the roles of specific cluster and Namespace-wide resources in this process:\n\n![Service Catalog flow](./assets/service-catalog-flow.svg)\n\n1.

The Kyma user can also register a Service Broker in a given Namespace.\n\n2. Inside the cluster, each ClusterServiceBroker exposes services that are ClusterServiceClasses in their different variations called ClusterServicePlans. Similarly, the ServiceBroker registered in a given Namespace exposes ServiceClasses and ServicePlans only in this specific Namespace.\n\n3. In the Console UI or CLI, the Kyma user lists all exposed cluster-wide and Namespace-specific services and requests to create instances of those services in the Namespace.\n\n4.

When you consume a specific ClusterServiceClass or a ServiceClass, and the system provisions a ServiceInstance, you need credentials for this service. To obtain credentials, create a ServiceBinding resource using the Service Catalog API. One instance can have numerous bindings to use in the application. When you raise a binding request, the system returns the credentials in the form of a Secret. The system creates a Secret in a given Namespace.\n\n> **NOTE:** The security in Kyma relies on the Kubernetes concept of a [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) which is a security boundary. If the Secret exists in the Namespace, the administrator can inject it to any Deployment. The Service Broker cannot prevent other applications from consuming a created Secret. Therefore, to ensure a stronger level of isolation and security, use a dedicated Namespace and request separate bindings for each Deployment.\n\nThe Secret allows you to run the service successfully. However, a problem appears each time you need to change the definition of the `yaml` file in the Deployment to specify the Secrets' usage. The manual process of editing the file is tedious and time-consuming. Kyma handles it by offering a custom resource called ServiceBindingUsage. This custom resource applies the Kubernetes [PodPreset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/podpreset/) resource and allows you to enforce an automated flow in which the Binding Usage Controller injects ServiceBindings into a given Deployment or Function.\n\n\n## Provisioning and binding flow\n\nThe diagram shows an overview of interactions between all resources related to Kyma provisioning and binding, and the reverting, deprovisioning, and unbinding operations.\n\n![Kyma provisioning and binding](./assets/provisioning-and-binding.png)\n\nThe process of provisioning and binding invokes the creation of three custom resources:\n- ServiceInstance\n- ServiceBinding\n- ServiceBindingUsage\n\nThe system allows you to create these custom resources in any order, but within a timeout period.\n\nWhen you invoke the deprovisioning and unbinding actions, the system deletes all three custom resources. Similar to the creation process dependencies, the system allows you to delete ServiceInstance and ServiceBinding in any order, but within a timeout period. However, before you delete the ServiceBinding, make sure you remove the ServiceBindingUsage first. For more details, see the [section](#details-provisioning-and-binding-delete-a-servicebinding) on deleting a ServiceBinding.\n\n### Provision a service\n\nTo provision a service, create a ServiceInstance custom resource. Generally speaking, provisioning is a process in which the Service Broker creates a new instance of a service. The form and scope of this instance depends on the Service Broker.\n\n![Kyma provisioning](./assets/provisioning.png)\n\n### Create a ServiceBinding\n\nKyma binding operation consists of two phases:\n1. The system gathers the information necessary to connect to the ServiceInstance and authenticate it. The Service Catalog handles this phase directly, without the use of any additional Kyma custom resources.\n2. The system must make the information it collected available to the application. Since the Service Catalog does not provide this functionality, you must create a ServiceBindingUsage custom resource.\n\n![Kyma binding](./assets/binding.png)\n\n> **NOTE:** The system allows you to create the ServiceBinding and ServiceBindingUsage resources at the same time.\n\n### Define other types of resources\n\nThe UsageKind is a cluster-wide custom resource which allows you to bind a ServiceInstance to any kind of resource. By default, Kyma provides two UsageKinds which enable binding either to a Deployment or a Function. You can add more UsageKinds if you want to bind your ServiceInstance to other types of resources. The UsageKind contains information on how the binding to these custom resources is conducted. The ServiceBindingUsage uses this information to inject Secrets to the application.\n\n![Kyma UsageKind](./assets/usagekind.png)\n\n\n### Delete a ServiceBinding\n\nKyma unbinding can be achieved in two ways:\n- Delete the ServiceBindingUsage. The Binding Usage Controller deletes the Secret injection, but the Secret itself still exists in the Namespace.\n- Delete the ServiceBinding. It deletes the Secret and triggers the deletion of all related ServiceBindingUsages.\n\n![Kyma unbinding](./assets/unbinding.png)\n\n### Deprovision a service\n\nTo deprovision a given service, delete the ServiceInstance custom resource. As part of this operation, the Service Broker deletes any resource created during the provisioning. When the process completes, the service becomes unavailable.\n\n![Kyma deprovisioning](./assets/deprovisioning.png)\n\n> **NOTE:** You can deprovision a service only if no corresponding ServiceBinding for a given ServiceInstance exists.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-03-backup-and-restore","title":"Service Catalog backup and restore","source":"\nIn the production setup, the Service Catalog uses the etcd database cluster which is defined in the Service Catalog [`etcd-stateful`][sc-etcd-sub-chart] sub-chart.

It renders as a dropdown menu, so it prevents the user from making mistakes.\n* If the field is required for the Service Class, mark it as **required**. UI blocks provisioning if you do not fill in the required fields.\n* Fill the **default** value for a field whenever possible, it makes the provisioning faster.\n* If the field, such as the password field, must be starred, use the **format** key with the **password** value.\n","type":"UI Contracts"},{"order":"11-03-instances-view","title":"Instances View","source":"\nThis document describes the mapping of [OSBA service objects](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#service-objects), [plan objects](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#plan-object), and [conventions](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/profile.md#service-metadata) in the Kyma Console Instances view.\n\n## Service Instances page\n\nThese are the OSBA fields used in the main Instances page:\n\n| Number | OSBA field                | Fallbacks            | Description                                                                  |\n| ------ | ------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| (1)    | not related to OSBA       | -                    | It is the name of the Service Instance, created during service provisioning. |\n| (2)    | **metadata.displayName**      | **name***, **id***           | If not provided, UI does not display this information.                       |\n| (3)    | **plan.metadata.displayName** | **plan.name***, **plan.id***| If not provided, UI does not display this information.                       |\n| (4)    | not related to OSBA       | -                    |                                                                              |\n| (5)    | not related to OSBA       | -                    |                                                                              |\n|        |\n\n\\*Fields with an asterisk are required OSBA attributes.\n\n![alt text](./assets/instances.png 'Service Instances')\n\n## Service Instance Details page\n\nThese are the OSBA fields used in the detailed Service Instance view:\n\n| Number | OSBA field                | Fallbacks            | Description                                           |\n| ------ | ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| (1)    | **metadata.displayName**      | **name***, **id***           | -                                                     |\n| (2)    | **plan.metadata.displayName** | **plan.name***, **plan.id*** | -                                                     |\n| (3)    | **metadata.documentationUrl** | -                    | If not provided, UI does not display this information |\n| (4)    | **metadata.supportUrl**       | -                    | If not provided, UI does not display this information |\n| (5)    | **description\\***             | -                    | If not provided, UI does not display this information |\n\n\\*Fields with an asterisk are required OSBA attributes.\n\n![alt text](./assets/instances-details.png 'Service Instance Details')\n","type":"UI Contracts"},{"order":"13-01-service-brokers","title":"Overview","source":"\nA Service Broker is a server compatible with the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md) specification.

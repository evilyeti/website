The main principle of Kyma Service Mesh operation is the process of injecting Pods of every service with an Envoy - a sidecar proxy which intercepts the communication between the services and regulates it by applying and enforcing the rules you create.

Use this command:</p>\n<pre><code>kubectl label namespace {YOUR_NAMESPACE} istio-injection=enabled\n</code></pre><p>With the sidecar proxy injection enabled, you can inject the sidecar to Pods of a selected deployment in the given Namespace.

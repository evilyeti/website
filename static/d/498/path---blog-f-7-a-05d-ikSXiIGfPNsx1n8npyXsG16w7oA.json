Use it to get information about important cluster endpoints, such as the Event Service URL. The new endpoint improves on the previous functionality which provided this information along with the certification requirements.</p>\n<h3>Certificate management</h3>\n<p>We added new functionalities centered around certificate management, such as signing certificates for Applications and Kyma clusters, <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/application-connector/#tutorials-renew-the-client-certificate\">renewing certificates</a>, and <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/application-connector/#tutorials-revoke-the-client-certificate\">certificate revocation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Proxy Service renaming</h3>\n<p>We renamed the Proxy Service to Application Gateway.</p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>If you upgrade Kyma 0.7 to version 0.8, you must manually update the IP address of the Application Connector Ingress Controller, as well as selectors on all services that exist in your cluster. If you experience any issues or you need help upgrading to Kyma 0.8, reach out to the <a href=\"https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CD0K2NSQZ\">\"application-connector\" Slack channel</a> to get direct support from the community.</p>\n<h2>Asset Store</h2>\n<h3>New cluster-wide resources added</h3>\n<p>We added two new cluster-wide resources, ClusterAsset and ClusterBucket. These resources allow you to fully use the Asset Store and build solutions using it. Read <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/asset-store/#custom-resource-clusterasset\">this document</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Package filtering</h3>\n<p>Assets now allow you to specify which folders should the Asset Store process using a regex expression. This feature adds a lot of flexibility and allows you to have packages that contain multiple files and directories, and use only the items that are relevant in a given scenario, without the need to create more packages.</p>\n<h3>Upload service</h3>\n<p>The newly introduced upload service enables easy integration for components that dynamically create and publish packages. By default, the service is configured to be accessible only from within the cluster. You can use the Upload Service to temporarily publish files that need to be referenced in assets. For details, read <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/asset-store#details-asset-upload-service\">this</a> document.</p>\n<h3>Minio monitoring</h3>\n<p>The Asset Store uses Minio as its backend, with a standalone setup on local deployment and a gateway mode as the recommended production setup. We enabled Minio monitoring and added a custom Grafana dashboard for this important component.</p>\n<h2>Backup and restore</h2>\n<h3>Backup and restore feature added</h3>\n<p>We implemented an <a href=\"https://github.com/heptio/velero/\">Ark</a>-based backup functionality in Kyma, allowing you to create manual and scheduled backups. Read our <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/backup/\">documentation</a> to learn how to configure backups, restore your cluster from backup, and set backup retention period.</p>\n<h3>E2E tests for backup and restore</h3>\n<p>We added a new pipeline to Prow which allows testing the backup and restore feature. The test pipeline runs daily. It creates a Kyma cluster and installs resources in the cluster. After it completes the setup phase, it creates a backup and removes all resources. Next, the resources are restored using the created backup and the pipeline verifies if all recreated resources are working as expected.</p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>Currently, the backup and restore feature doesn't cover all components. As a workaround, add the outstanding components to Ark configuration manually as described in the <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/backup/#details-back-up-a-kyma-cluster\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Console</h2>\n<h3>SAP Fiori Fundamentals</h3>\n<p>All views of the Console now use Fiori Fundamentals or one of its component libraries, <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx\"><code>fundamental-ngx</code></a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react\"><code>fundamental-react</code></a>.</p>\n<h3>Support for system Namespaces</h3>\n<p>The system Namespaces of your Kyma cluster are now displayed in the Console alongside the user-created ones. The system Namespaces have reduced functionality and don't allow the users to perform certain actions, such as creating lambdas.</p>\n<h3>Create RoleBindings for users</h3>\n<p>We added the ability to create RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings for specific users through the Console.</p>\n<h3>Catalog view enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Provision only once\" classes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some Service Classes can be provisioned only once in a given Namespace. They are mostly brokers from different cloud providers. We made it clear in the UI that certain classes can be used only once or cannot be provisioned again if they are already in use. We also indicated how many instances of Service Classes that can be provisioned multiple times already exist in the cluster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./provision_once.png\" alt=\"Provision only once classes\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OData specification rendering</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kyma allows you to register REST APIs as well as OData APIs. The Console now supports not only OpenAPI but also OData spec rendering. We developed a new component and integrated it in the Service Catalog views to support this use case. Currently, we support OData v2, v3, and v4. We support only <code>XML</code> as the input data format and we transform older OData versions to v4.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./odata.png\" alt=\"OData spec\"></p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>After you upgrade Kyma to the 0.8 version, you might be unable to log in to the Console. To counter this issue, clear your browser cache manually and try logging in again.</p>\n<h2>Eventing</h2>\n<h3>Consuming Events served by Knative Eventing</h3>\n<p>Running Kyma with the <code>--knative</code> flag now allows you to consume Events served by Knative.</p>\n<h3>Restricted Client access enabled for NATS Streaming</h3>\n<p>Only Event Bus applications can connect to NATS Streaming using client authentication.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<h3>Removed the Minikube version constraint</h3>\n<p>We removed the Minikube version constraint. You can now use any compatible version, not necessarily the exact one found in Kyma sources.</p>\n<h3>Kubernetes version upgrade</h3>\n<p>Cluster deployments now use Kubernetes version 1.12.</p>\n<h2>Logging</h2>\n<h3>OK Log replaced with Loki</h3>\n<p>In this release, we replaced OK Log with a new logging solution - Loki. Dubbed the \"Prometheus for logs\", Loki fits Kyma very well. It's lightweight, actively maintained, and integrated with Grafana, which lets you see metrics and logs for your Pods all in one place. For now, we replaced the main logging functionality, which means that the logs are collected by Loki but can be accessed only through an internal API. We will expose the API and activate Grafana integration in the upcoming release. Please remember that our logging solution is in alpha state. Your feedback is welcome!</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<h3>Kyma-developer role</h3>\n<p>We introduced a new cluster-wide role suited for developers working with Kyma. The <strong>kyma-developer</strong> role has fewer privileges than the existing <strong>kyma-admin</strong> role but allows for more access than the existing, Namespace-specific <strong>kyma-reader</strong> role. Assign the new role to any developer that develop solutions in your cluster. Read <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/security/#tutorials-manage-static-users-in-dex-bind-a-user-to-a-role-or-a-clusterrole\">this</a> document for more information.</p>\n<h3>Shorter ID token TTL</h3>\n<p>Starting with the 0.8 release, all ID tokens fetched from Dex have a TTL of 8 hours.</p>\n<h3>Support for kubectl exec command</h3>\n<p>The API Server Proxy now supports the <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper\">SPDY</a> protocol, which is used for handling kubectl commands such as <code>exec</code>. Developers can now use all kubectl commands when they connect to a cluster with a generated <code>kubeconfig</code> file.</p>\n<h2>Serverless</h2>\n<h3>Logging of function's source code before execution</h3>\n<p>Functions are logging their source code and <code>package.json</code> content before they are executed. This allows you to track what code is executed inside function Pods.</p>\n<h2>Service Catalog</h2>\n<h3>Define the URLs of the repositories that hold your bundles in the Helm Broker</h3>\n<p>You can now instantly update the URLs of your bundles repositories in the Helm Broker, with no need to restart. For more information, read <a href=\"/docs/0.8/components/helm-broker#configuration-configure-helm-broker-add-a-new-bundle-repository\">this</a> document.</p>\n<h2>kyma-project.io</h2>\n<h3>Backend refactoring</h3>\n<p>We refactored the backend of the website to improve the speed of future implementations.</p>\n<h3>Bugfixes</h3>\n<p>We fixed multiple smaller bugs, including a particularly annoying one that caused the horizontal scroll bar to overlap the code in code snippet fields.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./scroll_bar_bug.png\" alt=\"Scroll bar\"></p>\n<h3>New features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Copy button for code snippets\n<img src=\"./copy_button.png\" alt=\"Copy button\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New tabs layout suitable for displaying instructions in different versions\n<img src=\"./tabs_layout.png\" alt=\"Tabs layout\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New panel types help differentiate between notes, caution indicators, and tips\n<img src=\"./panels.png\" alt=\"Panels\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A special icon indicates that clicking a link takes you outside of the website and opens a new tab\n<img src=\"./link_icon.png\" alt=\"External link icon\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The new section on the main page introduces Kyma early adopters that agreed to be mentioned on the website\n<img src=\"./early_adopters.png\" alt=\"Early adopters section\"></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The 0.8 release is packed with new features and improvements that bring your experience to a new level.

The Kyma-Knative integration continues, making it now possible to both publish and consume Events using Knative Eventing. You can now back up a Kyma cluster manually or schedule periodic backups. The Minikube version constraint is removed, allowing you to use any compatible Minikube version. The Application Connector got even more powerful with certificate signing, renewal, and revocation, as well as a brand new information endpoint. Other significant improvements include replacing OK Log with Grafana Loki, switching all Console views to SAP Fiori Fundamentals, and the introduction of the **kyma-developer** role.  \n<!-- overview -->\n\nThe highlights of Kyma 0.8 Edmonton include:\n\n- [Consuming Events with Knative](#consuming-events-served-by-knative-eventing) - We enabled Event consumption using Knative Eventing.\n- [Backup](#backup-and-restore-feature-added) - We introduced a backup and restore feature to Kyma.\n- [Removing Minikube constraint](#removed-the-minikube-version-constraint) - We removed the Minikube version constraint that forced users to use the same version as Kyma sources.\n- [Information endpoint](#information-endpoint) and [certificate management](#certificate-management) make the Application Connector even more powerful.\n- [Replacing OK Log with Loki](#ok-log-replaced-with-loki) - We switched our old logging solution to Loki, which is lightweight, actively maintained, and integrated with Grafana.\n- [Adding a new kyma-developer role](#kyma-developer-role) - We added a new **kyma-developer** role which is suited for developers working with Kyma clusters.\n- [All Console views using SAP Fiori](#sap-fiori-fundamentals) - All views in the Console now use SAP Fiori Fundamentals or one of its component libraries, [`fundamental-ngx`](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx) or [`fundamental-react`](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react).\n\nSee the overview of all changes in this release:\n\n- [Application Connector](#application-connector) - Information endpoint, certificate signing, certificate renewal, certificate revocation, Proxy Service renaming\n- [Asset Store](#asset-store) - New cluster-wide resources added, package filtering, Minio monitoring\n- [Backup and Restore](#backup-and-restore) - Backup and restore feature added, E2E tests for backup and restore\n- [Console](#console) - All views use SAP Fiori Fundamentals, support for system Namespaces, creating bindings for users, OData spec rendering and \"provision only once\" classes in the Catalog view\n- [Eventing](#eventing) - Consuming Events served by Knative Eventing\n- [Installation](#installation) - Removed the Minikube version constraint, Kubernetes upgraded to 1.12\n- [Logging](#logging) - Replaced OK Log with Loki\n- [Security](#security) - New **kyma-developer** role, shorter ID token TTL, support for the kubectl `exec` command\n- [Serverless](#serverless) - Logging of function's source code before execution\n- [Service Catalog](#service-catalog) - Defining the URLs of the repositories that hold your bundles in the Helm Broker at runtime\n- [kyma-project.io](#kyma-project-io) - Backend refactoring, bugfixes, new tab layout, information panels, new external link icon\n\n---\n\n## Application Connector\n\n### Information endpoint\n\nThe new `GetInfo` endpoint returns information about the cluster. Use it to get information about important cluster endpoints, such as the Event Service URL. The new endpoint improves on the previous functionality which provided this information along with the certification requirements.\n\n### Certificate management\n\nWe added new functionalities centered around certificate management, such as signing certificates for Applications and Kyma clusters, [renewing certificates](/docs/0.8/components/application-connector/#tutorials-renew-the-client-certificate), and [certificate revocation](/docs/0.8/components/application-connector/#tutorials-revoke-the-client-certificate).\n\n### Proxy Service renaming\n\nWe renamed the Proxy Service to Application Gateway.\n\n### Known issues\n\nIf you upgrade Kyma 0.7 to version 0.8, you must manually update the IP address of the Application Connector Ingress Controller, as well as selectors on all services that exist in your cluster. If you experience any issues or you need help upgrading to Kyma 0.8, reach out to the [\"application-connector\" Slack channel](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CD0K2NSQZ) to get direct support from the community.\n\n\n## Asset Store\n\n### New cluster-wide resources added\n\nWe added two new cluster-wide resources, ClusterAsset and ClusterBucket. These resources allow you to fully use the Asset Store and build solutions using it. Read [this document](/docs/0.8/components/asset-store/#custom-resource-clusterasset) for more information.\n\n### Package filtering\n\nAssets now allow you to specify which folders should the Asset Store process using a regex expression. This feature adds a lot of flexibility and allows you to have packages that contain multiple files and directories, and use only the items that are relevant in a given scenario, without the need to create more packages.\n\n### Upload service\n\nThe newly introduced upload service enables easy integration for components that dynamically create and publish packages. By default, the service is configured to be accessible only from within the cluster. You can use the Upload Service to temporarily publish files that need to be referenced in assets. For details, read [this](/docs/0.8/components/asset-store#details-asset-upload-service ) document.\n\n### Minio monitoring\n\nThe Asset Store uses Minio as its backend, with a standalone setup on local deployment and a gateway mode as the recommended production setup. We enabled Minio monitoring and added a custom Grafana dashboard for this important component.\n\n\n## Backup and restore\n\n### Backup and restore feature added\n\nWe implemented an [Ark](https://github.com/heptio/velero/)-based backup functionality in Kyma, allowing you to create manual and scheduled backups. Read our [documentation](/docs/0.8/components/backup/) to learn how to configure backups, restore your cluster from backup, and set backup retention period.\n\n### E2E tests for backup and restore\n\nWe added a new pipeline to Prow which allows testing the backup and restore feature. The test pipeline runs daily. It creates a Kyma cluster and installs resources in the cluster. After it completes the setup phase, it creates a backup and removes all resources. Next, the resources are restored using the created backup and the pipeline verifies if all recreated resources are working as expected.\n\n### Known issues\n\nCurrently, the backup and restore feature doesn't cover all components. As a workaround, add the outstanding components to Ark configuration manually as described in the [documentation](/docs/0.8/components/backup/#details-back-up-a-kyma-cluster).\n\n\n## Console\n\n### SAP Fiori Fundamentals\n\nAll views of the Console now use Fiori Fundamentals or one of its component libraries, [`fundamental-ngx`](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx) or [`fundamental-react`](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react).\n\n### Support for system Namespaces\n\nThe system Namespaces of your Kyma cluster are now displayed in the Console alongside the user-created ones. The system Namespaces have reduced functionality and don't allow the users to perform certain actions, such as creating lambdas.\n\n### Create RoleBindings for users\n\nWe added the ability to create RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings for specific users through the Console.\n\n### Catalog view enhancements\n\n- \"Provision only once\" classes\n\nSome Service Classes can be provisioned only once in a given Namespace. They are mostly brokers from different cloud providers. We made it clear in the UI that certain classes can be used only once or cannot be provisioned again if they are already in use. We also indicated how many instances of Service Classes that can be provisioned multiple times already exist in the cluster.\n\n![Provision only once classes](./provision_once.png)\n\n- OData specification rendering\n\nKyma allows you to register REST APIs as well as OData APIs. The Console now supports not only OpenAPI but also OData spec rendering. We developed a new component and integrated it in the Service Catalog views to support this use case. Currently, we support OData v2, v3, and v4. We support only `XML` as the input data format and we transform older OData versions to v4.\n\n![OData spec](./odata.png)\n\n### Known issues\n\nAfter you upgrade Kyma to the 0.8 version, you might be unable to log in to the Console. To counter this issue, clear your browser cache manually and try logging in again.\n\n\n## Eventing\n\n### Consuming Events served by Knative Eventing\n\nRunning Kyma with the `--knative` flag now allows you to consume Events served by Knative.\n\n### Restricted Client access enabled for NATS Streaming\n\nOnly Event Bus applications can connect to NATS Streaming using client authentication.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Removed the Minikube version constraint\n\nWe removed the Minikube version constraint. You can now use any compatible version, not necessarily the exact one found in Kyma sources.\n\n### Kubernetes version upgrade\n\nCluster deployments now use Kubernetes version 1.12.\n\n\n## Logging\n\n### OK Log replaced with Loki\n\nIn this release, we replaced OK Log with a new logging solution - Loki. Dubbed the \"Prometheus for logs\", Loki fits Kyma very well. It's lightweight, actively maintained, and integrated with Grafana, which lets you see metrics and logs for your Pods all in one place. For now, we replaced the main logging functionality, which means that the logs are collected by Loki but can be accessed only through an internal API. We will expose the API and activate Grafana integration in the upcoming release. Please remember that our logging solution is in alpha state. Your feedback is welcome!\n\n\n\n## Security\n\n### Kyma-developer role\n\nWe introduced a new cluster-wide role suited for developers working with Kyma. The **kyma-developer** role has fewer privileges than the existing **kyma-admin** role but allows for more access than the existing, Namespace-specific **kyma-reader** role. Assign the new role to any developer that develop solutions in your cluster. Read [this](/docs/0.8/components/security/#tutorials-manage-static-users-in-dex-bind-a-user-to-a-role-or-a-clusterrole) document for more information.\n\n### Shorter ID token TTL\n\nStarting with the 0.8 release, all ID tokens fetched from Dex have a TTL of 8 hours.\n\n### Support for kubectl exec command\n\nThe API Server Proxy now supports the [SPDY](https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper) protocol, which is used for handling kubectl commands such as `exec`. Developers can now use all kubectl commands when they connect to a cluster with a generated `kubeconfig` file.\n\n\n## Serverless\n\n### Logging of function's source code before execution\n\nFunctions are logging their source code and `package.json` content before they are executed. This allows you to track what code is executed inside function Pods.\n\n\n## Service Catalog\n\n### Define the URLs of the repositories that hold your bundles in the Helm Broker\n\nYou can now instantly update the URLs of your bundles repositories in the Helm Broker, with no need to restart. For more information, read [this](/docs/0.8/components/helm-broker#configuration-configure-helm-broker-add-a-new-bundle-repository) document.\n\n\n## kyma-project.io\n\n### Backend refactoring\n\nWe refactored the backend of the website to improve the speed of future implementations.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\nWe fixed multiple smaller bugs, including a particularly annoying one that caused the horizontal scroll bar to overlap the code in code snippet fields.\n\n![Scroll bar](./scroll_bar_bug.png)\n\n### New features\n\n- Copy button for code snippets\n![Copy button](./copy_button.png)\n\n- New tabs layout suitable for displaying instructions in different versions\n![Tabs layout](./tabs_layout.png)\n\n- New panel types help differentiate between notes, caution indicators, and tips\n![Panels](./panels.png)\n\n- A special icon indicates that clicking a link takes you outside of the website and opens a new tab\n![External link icon](./link_icon.png)\n\n- The new section on the main page introduces Kyma early adopters that agreed to be mentioned on the website\n![Early adopters section](./early_adopters.png)\n","excerpt":"\nThe 0.8 release is packed with new features and improvements that bring your experience to a new level.

When you register an API with a client certificate, the Application Registry generates a ready-to-use certificate and key pair for this API to secure it. You can use the generated pair or replace it with your own certificate and key. For details, see <a href=\"/docs/0.7/components/application-connector#tutorials-register-a-secured-api\">this</a> document.</p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>If you run Kyma on Minikube, you must expose the Nginx Ingress Controller on the dedicated NodePort. However, URLs returned from the Connector Service do not include the value for this port. To fix it, update URLs manually using the information in <a href=\"/docs/0.7/components/application-connector#api-application-registry\">this</a> guide.</p>\n<h2>Asset Store</h2>\n<h3>Asset Store introduction</h3>\n<p>We have introduced the alpha version of a new, Kubernetes-native solution for storing assets, such as documents, files, images, or API specifications.</p>\n<p>This version of the Asset Store brings you the following features included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core/proposals/asset-store-proposal.md\">Asset Store proposal</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fetching single files and packages (zip and tar files are supported for unpacking).</li>\n<li>Starting Minio in the Minio Gateway mode to push resources to cloud providers, such as Azure or Google Cloud.</li>\n<li>Providing custom validation services for assets to validate them before uploading them to the storage.</li>\n<li>Providing custom mutation services for assets to modify them before uploading them to the storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the coming releases, we plan to address the remaining features from the proposal. If you are interested in contributing, feel free to contact us on <a href=\"http://slack.kyma-project.io\">Slack</a>. Meanwhile, read <a href=\"/docs/0.7/components/asset-store#overview-overview\">this</a> document to find out more about the Asset Store component.</p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>Switching Asset Store to recommended production mode, with Minio Gateway under the hood and Google Cloud Storage support, requires additional manual configuration. This is because for this release the Minio setup must support our legacy solution and default <strong>content</strong> bucket setup. The problem is caused by the limitation of Google Cloud Storage which requires the bucket name to be globally unique. For details and configuration steps read <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/assetstore/README.md\">this</a> document.</p>\n<h2>Console</h2>\n<h3>UI views migrated to SAP Fiori Fundamentals</h3>\n<p>We have migrated Console UI views to SAP Fiori Fundamentals. For the core Console UI we used the <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx\">Fundamental NGX</a> library, and the UI views were built on <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react\">Fundamental React</a>. In addition to the migration, we added the missing UI tests and improved the existing ones. This way, we covered all end-to-end scenarios for the Service Catalog views and based them on the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/tree/master/bundles/testing-0.0.1\">testing bundle</a>.</p>\n<h3>View modularization</h3>\n<p>We have extracted the optional views configuration from the core Console UI to create separate micro frontends. The micro frontends embedded in the Console receive information about installed Kyma modules to resiliently show the UI components relevant for these modules.</p>\n<h3>Node visibility restrictions</h3>\n<p>The visibility of navigation nodes in the Console UI now depends on user access rights. For example, only <code>kyma-admins</code> can see Kyma cluster settings.</p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>Browsers use cached file versions from previous Kyma releases instead of fetching new ones automatically. So far, there is no built-in cache breaker mechanism. To fix this issue, you need to manually clear the browser cache to make sure the Console UI works properly after installing a new Kyma version.</p>\n<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>\n<h3>New CI pipelines</h3>\n<p>We have introduced nightly and weekly CI pipelines to perform tests and identify any potential issues, such as incorrect settings or memory leaks. The pipelines run Kyma on Google Kubernetes Engine using the master branch. If you are interested in details, go to <code>https://status.build.kyma-project.io/?type=periodic</code> and search for <strong>kyma-gke-nightly</strong> and <strong>kyma-gke-weekly</strong> jobs. We are also planning to add Slack notification for test results.</p>\n<h2>Eventing</h2>\n<h3>Event Publishing with Knative Eventing</h3>\n<p>As a result of continuous Kyma-Knative integration, you can now deploy Kyma with a <code>--knative</code> feature flag. It allows you to use the Publish API provided by Knative Eventing.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<h3>Upgrade to Minikube v0.33.0</h3>\n<p>We have upgraded Minikube to version <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-0330---2019-01-17\">0.33.0</a>. This means we can now use the stable <code>kubeadm</code> bootstrapper instead of the deprecated <code>localkube</code>. This helps us to leverage new features and improves the stability of local installations.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade to Kubernetes v1.11.5</h3>\n<p>You can now deploy Kyma using Kubernetes v1.11.5, to enjoy improved stability and new Kubernetes feature. One of them is the Status subresource for CRDs, which summarizes the current state of the object in the system.</p>\n<h3>Kyma on AKS</h3>\n<p>You can now smoothly deploy Kyma on an AKS cluster, using a chosen release version or even a particular commit. <a href=\"/docs/0.7/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-an-aks-cluster\">Install</a> Kyma on a cluster using a proprietary installer based on a Kubernetes operator. If you want to try out Kyma on a cluster without assigning the cluster to a domain you own, you can use <code>xip.io</code> which provides a wildcard DNS for any IP address. For details, see <a href=\"/docs/0.7/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-an-aks-cluster-with-wildcard-dns\">this guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>kyma-default ResourceQuota removed</h3>\n<p>You can install Kyma on Kubernetes clusters such as AKS or GKE, which allow Node autoscaling. Therefore, we removed the <code>kyma-default</code> ResourceQuota with a memory limit defined for resources. That change affects the <code>kyma-system</code>, <code>kyma-integration</code>, and <code>kyma-installer</code> Namespaces. Namespaces labelled with <code>env=true</code> still have the <code>kyma-default</code> ResourceQuota defined.</p>\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\n<h3>New alert rule for Persistent Volumes</h3>\n<p>We are constantly increasing the number of default alert rules, so you can receive alerts for affected components. The newest addition to the set is the alert rule for Persistent Volumes, activated when the volume used in the <code>kyma-system</code> Namespace exceeds 90%.</p>\n<h3>Optional Prometheus Operator</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Operator module used to be required in any Kyma setup. To increase flexibility, we moved the ServiceManager CRD from the Prometheus Operator to the CRD set provided by Kyma. This way, you can define Service Management resources for your components without the need to install the Prometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<h3>UI API Layer security model</h3>\n<p>We have switched from a custom Istio RBAC implementation based on Envoy to Kubernetes RBAC. The reason was to avoid difficulties of developing and maintaining the LUA filters for Envoy. Additionally, the current implementation uses Go, which makes it more lightweight and flexible. Read the <a href=\"/docs/0.7/components/security#details-graphql\">documentation</a> to learn the details on securing resources in GraphQL using queries, mutations, and subscriptions.</p>\n<h2>Service Catalog</h2>\n<h3>Azure Service Broker runtime bundling and installation</h3>\n<p>Kyma allows you to integrate with the Azure Service Broker in an easy way, and to use the vast range of Service Classes it provides. Each Service Class is comprehensively described in the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/docs/service-brokers\">documentation</a>. Read more about the Azure Service Broker <a href=\"https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/helm-broker#overview-azure-broker\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>One-time provisioning for Helm Broker</h3>\n<p>The Helm Broker now supports the <code>provisionOnlyOnce</code> flag which defines that the bundle should be provisioned only once for a given Namespace. We have also added this flag to the Azure Service Broker and the GCP Service Broker bundle configurations. For details, read <a href=\"/docs/0.7/components/helm-broker#configuration-binding-bundles\">this</a> document.</p>\n<h2>Service Catalog standalone installation</h2>\n<p>We took further steps to modularize the Service Catalog by moving <code>service-catalog-addons</code> and <code>helm-broker</code> charts out of the <code>core</code> chart directory. This way, it's up to you to decide which components to install. When other Kyma components will be moved out of the <code>core</code> chart, you will be able to install Kyma with the Service Catalog only.</p>\n<h2>Service Mesh</h2>\n<h3>Default Istio sidecar injection</h3>\n<p>By default, the Istio sidecar injector watches all Pod creation operations on all Namespaces and injects the newly created Pods with a sidecar proxy. To disable proxy injection for a Namespace, add the <code>istio-injection=disabled</code> label. To disable proxy injection on a Pod level, add the <code>sidecar.istio.io/inject:false</code> label to a Pod.</p>\n<h3>API Server Proxy autoscaling</h3>\n<p>To increase the availability of components, we have enabled the autoscaling of the API Server Proxy component. Based on the memory usage metric, the system decides whether you should deploy an additional instance of the API Server Proxy.</p>\n<h3>Startup scripts improvements</h3>\n<p>To simplify the local deployments, the startup scripts now accept the <code>--password</code> argument. Running the scripts with this argument allows you to install Kyma locally and set a password for the admin user. This way, you don't need to fetch and decode the password generated for every deployment.  </p>\n<h2>Tracing</h2>\n<h3>Tracing UI elements renaming</h3>\n<p>We renamed the services and operations displayed in the Tracing UI to provide clarity and better user experience.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The 0.7 release brings you features and improvements to further enhance your Kyma experience.

The alpha version of the Asset Store component gives you a solution for storing assets, such as documents, files, images, or API specifications. The ongoing CI development resulted in new pipelines which you can use to run Kyma installation and intercept any installation-related issues. The Kyma-Knative integration continues, making it possible to publish Events using Knative Eventing. Other significant improvements allow you to install Kyma on AKS, keep your resources secure with the new security model, and benefit from smoother and simplified Kyma deployment process.\n<!-- overview -->\n\nThe highlights of Kyma 0.7 Dublin include:\n\n- [Asset Store](#asset-store) - We introduced a brand new component for storing assets.\n- [Publishing Events with Knative](#event-publishing-with-knative-eventing) - We enabled Event publishing using Knative Eventing.\n- [New CI pipelines](#new-ci-pipelines) - We set up new CI pipelines to run Kyma installation on GKE and identify potential issues.\n- [Kyma on AKS](#kyma-on-aks) - We enabled Kyma installation on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).\n- [API Server Proxy autoscaling](#api-server-proxy-autoscaling), [removed kyma-default ResourceQuota](#kyma-default-resourcequota-removed), and [tweaked startup scripts](#startup-scripts-improvements) that simplify the Kyma deployment process.\n- [UI API Layer security model (GraphQL)](#ui-api-layer-security-model) - We switched from a custom Istio RBAC implementation to Kubernetes RBAC to bring you a lightweight and flexible solution for securing your resources.\n\n\n\nSee the overview of all changes in this release:\n\n\n- [Application Connector](#application-connector) - Increased Application Registry memory limit, API secured with client certificates\n- [Asset Store](#asset-store) - Asset Store introduction\n- [Console](#console) - UI views migrated to SAP Fiori Fundamentals, view modularization, node visibility restrictions\n- [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration) - New CI pipelines\n- [Eventing](#eventing) - Publishing integrated with Knative Eventing\n- [Installation](#installation) - Upgrade to Minikube v0.33.0, upgrade to Kubernetes v1.11.5, Kyma on Azure Kubernetes Service, resource quota removed from system Namespaces\n- [Monitoring](#monitoring) - New alert rule for Persistent Volumes, optional Prometheus Operator\n- [Security](#security) - UI API Layer security model\n- [Service Catalog](#service-catalog) - Azure Service Broker runtime bundling and installation, one-time provisioning for Helm Broker, Service Catalog standalone installation\n- [Service Mesh](#service-mesh) - Default Istio sidecar injection, API Server Proxy autoscaling, startup scripts improvements\n- [Tracing](#tracing) - Tracing UI elements renaming\n\n\n---\n\n## Application Connector\n\n### Increased Application Registry memory limit\n\nWe have increased the default memory limit for the Application Registry payload to 5 MB to enable registration of extensive API specifications.\n\n### API secured with client certificates\n\nApplication Proxy allows you to secure APIs with generated client certificates. When you register an API with a client certificate, the Application Registry generates a ready-to-use certificate and key pair for this API to secure it. You can use the generated pair or replace it with your own certificate and key. For details, see [this](/docs/0.7/components/application-connector#tutorials-register-a-secured-api) document.\n\n### Known issues\n\nIf you run Kyma on Minikube, you must expose the Nginx Ingress Controller on the dedicated NodePort. However, URLs returned from the Connector Service do not include the value for this port. To fix it, update URLs manually using the information in [this](/docs/0.7/components/application-connector#api-application-registry) guide.\n\n## Asset Store\n\n### Asset Store introduction\n\nWe have introduced the alpha version of a new, Kubernetes-native solution for storing assets, such as documents, files, images, or API specifications.\n\nThis version of the Asset Store brings you the following features included in the [Asset Store proposal](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core/proposals/asset-store-proposal.md):\n\n* Fetching single files and packages (zip and tar files are supported for unpacking).\n* Starting Minio in the Minio Gateway mode to push resources to cloud providers, such as Azure or Google Cloud.\n* Providing custom validation services for assets to validate them before uploading them to the storage.\n* Providing custom mutation services for assets to modify them before uploading them to the storage.\n\n\nIn the coming releases, we plan to address the remaining features from the proposal. If you are interested in contributing, feel free to contact us on [Slack](http://slack.kyma-project.io). Meanwhile, read [this](/docs/0.7/components/asset-store#overview-overview) document to find out more about the Asset Store component.\n\n### Known issues\n\nSwitching Asset Store to recommended production mode, with Minio Gateway under the hood and Google Cloud Storage support, requires additional manual configuration. This is because for this release the Minio setup must support our legacy solution and default **content** bucket setup. The problem is caused by the limitation of Google Cloud Storage which requires the bucket name to be globally unique. For details and configuration steps read [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/resources/assetstore/README.md) document.\n\n## Console\n\n### UI views migrated to SAP Fiori Fundamentals\n\nWe have migrated Console UI views to SAP Fiori Fundamentals. For the core Console UI we used the [Fundamental NGX](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx) library, and the UI views were built on [Fundamental React](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react). In addition to the migration, we added the missing UI tests and improved the existing ones. This way, we covered all end-to-end scenarios for the Service Catalog views and based them on the [testing bundle](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/tree/master/bundles/testing-0.0.1).\n\n### View modularization\n\nWe have extracted the optional views configuration from the core Console UI to create separate micro frontends. The micro frontends embedded in the Console receive information about installed Kyma modules to resiliently show the UI components relevant for these modules.\n\n### Node visibility restrictions\n\nThe visibility of navigation nodes in the Console UI now depends on user access rights. For example, only `kyma-admins` can see Kyma cluster settings.\n\n### Known issues\n\nBrowsers use cached file versions from previous Kyma releases instead of fetching new ones automatically. So far, there is no built-in cache breaker mechanism. To fix this issue, you need to manually clear the browser cache to make sure the Console UI works properly after installing a new Kyma version.\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\n### New CI pipelines\n\nWe have introduced nightly and weekly CI pipelines to perform tests and identify any potential issues, such as incorrect settings or memory leaks. The pipelines run Kyma on Google Kubernetes Engine using the master branch. If you are interested in details, go to `https://status.build.kyma-project.io/?type=periodic` and search for **kyma-gke-nightly** and **kyma-gke-weekly** jobs. We are also planning to add Slack notification for test results.\n\n## Eventing\n\n### Event Publishing with Knative Eventing\n\nAs a result of continuous Kyma-Knative integration, you can now deploy Kyma with a `--knative` feature flag. It allows you to use the Publish API provided by Knative Eventing.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Upgrade to Minikube v0.33.0\n\nWe have upgraded Minikube to version [0.33.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-0330---2019-01-17). This means we can now use the stable `kubeadm` bootstrapper instead of the deprecated `localkube`. This helps us to leverage new features and improves the stability of local installations.\n\n### Upgrade to Kubernetes v1.11.5\n\nYou can now deploy Kyma using Kubernetes v1.11.5, to enjoy improved stability and new Kubernetes feature. One of them is the Status subresource for CRDs, which summarizes the current state of the object in the system.\n\n### Kyma on AKS\n\nYou can now smoothly deploy Kyma on an AKS cluster, using a chosen release version or even a particular commit. [Install](/docs/0.7/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-an-aks-cluster) Kyma on a cluster using a proprietary installer based on a Kubernetes operator. If you want to try out Kyma on a cluster without assigning the cluster to a domain you own, you can use `xip.io` which provides a wildcard DNS for any IP address. For details, see [this guide](/docs/0.7/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-an-aks-cluster-with-wildcard-dns).\n\n\n### kyma-default ResourceQuota removed  \n\nYou can install Kyma on Kubernetes clusters such as AKS or GKE, which allow Node autoscaling. Therefore, we removed the `kyma-default` ResourceQuota with a memory limit defined for resources. That change affects the `kyma-system`, `kyma-integration`, and `kyma-installer` Namespaces. Namespaces labelled with `env=true` still have the `kyma-default` ResourceQuota defined.\n\n## Monitoring\n\n### New alert rule for Persistent Volumes\n\nWe are constantly increasing the number of default alert rules, so you can receive alerts for affected components. The newest addition to the set is the alert rule for Persistent Volumes, activated when the volume used in the `kyma-system` Namespace exceeds 90%.\n\n### Optional Prometheus Operator\n\nThe Prometheus Operator module used to be required in any Kyma setup. To increase flexibility, we moved the ServiceManager CRD from the Prometheus Operator to the CRD set provided by Kyma. This way, you can define Service Management resources for your components without the need to install the Prometheus Operator.\n\n## Security\n\n###  UI API Layer security model\n\nWe have switched from a custom Istio RBAC implementation based on Envoy to Kubernetes RBAC. The reason was to avoid difficulties of developing and maintaining the LUA filters for Envoy. Additionally, the current implementation uses Go, which makes it more lightweight and flexible. Read the [documentation](/docs/0.7/components/security#details-graphql) to learn the details on securing resources in GraphQL using queries, mutations, and subscriptions.\n\n## Service Catalog\n\n### Azure Service Broker runtime bundling and installation\n\nKyma allows you to integrate with the Azure Service Broker in an easy way, and to use the vast range of Service Classes it provides. Each Service Class is comprehensively described in the [documentation](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/docs/service-brokers). Read more about the Azure Service Broker [here](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/helm-broker#overview-azure-broker).\n\n### One-time provisioning for Helm Broker\n\nThe Helm Broker now supports the `provisionOnlyOnce` flag which defines that the bundle should be provisioned only once for a given Namespace. We have also added this flag to the Azure Service Broker and the GCP Service Broker bundle configurations. For details, read [this](/docs/0.7/components/helm-broker#configuration-binding-bundles) document.\n\n## Service Catalog standalone installation\n\nWe took further steps to modularize the Service Catalog by moving `service-catalog-addons` and `helm-broker` charts out of the `core` chart directory. This way, it's up to you to decide which components to install. When other Kyma components will be moved out of the `core` chart, you will be able to install Kyma with the Service Catalog only.\n\n## Service Mesh\n\n### Default Istio sidecar injection\n\nBy default, the Istio sidecar injector watches all Pod creation operations on all Namespaces and injects the newly created Pods with a sidecar proxy. To disable proxy injection for a Namespace, add the `istio-injection=disabled` label. To disable proxy injection on a Pod level, add the `sidecar.istio.io/inject:false` label to a Pod.\n\n### API Server Proxy autoscaling\n\nTo increase the availability of components, we have enabled the autoscaling of the API Server Proxy component. Based on the memory usage metric, the system decides whether you should deploy an additional instance of the API Server Proxy.\n\n### Startup scripts improvements\n\nTo simplify the local deployments, the startup scripts now accept the `--password` argument. Running the scripts with this argument allows you to install Kyma locally and set a password for the admin user. This way, you don't need to fetch and decode the password generated for every deployment.  \n\n\n## Tracing\n\n### Tracing UI elements renaming             \n\nWe renamed the services and operations displayed in the Tracing UI to provide clarity and better user experience.\n","excerpt":"\nThe 0.7 release brings you features and improvements to further enhance your Kyma experience.

The capital of Ireland was chosen to be the codename for the upcoming Kyma 0.7 release which is scheduled to launch on 11th February 2019. Only 4 weeks after the 0.6 release! We're pretty excited and proud about how we improved our tooling and release process, which allows us to release more frequently. Thanks to these improvements, starting with the Dublin release, we will release a new version of Kyma every 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>What can you expect at the end of the rainbow? </p>\n<!-- overview -->\n<p>Although we're making progress fast, we don't forget about our users. We don't leave anyone behind and we aim to make updating Kyma as simple as possible. We want all users to simply grab a new version of the Kyma installer, deploy it, upgrade their deployment to the newest version, and start exploring new features in no time. This might sound really simple, but brings a lot of challenges for our project which is still in the beta phase and changes constantly. Despite the challenges, we're getting ready to implement the easy upgrade flow in the near future. As a part of these preparations, the 0.7 release will bring a new CI/CD pipeline to verify Kyma upgradeability continuously.</p>\n<p>The 0.6 release introduced a feature toggle that enables Knative in Kyma installation. In the Dublin release, we will integrate event publishing and subscriptions with Knative Eventing. We will also deliver the first version of the Function Controller that supports Knative as the serverless engine.</p>\n<p>With the 0.7 release, we aim to improve quality and stability by adding more end-to-end tests and pipelines that will run these tests on long-running clusters. So far the stability tests ran exclusively on nightly clusters. With the Dublin release, we will introduce weekly clusters to help ensure that no issues pop up after a few days of working with the cluster. We will also tweak Kyma deployments to work better with cluster autoscaling, for example by adjusting the apiserver-proxy deployment and resource quotas in system Namespaces.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to run Kyma on any Kubernetes cluster offered as a managed service. Currently, our default environment is the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). In the upcoming release, we will tweak our deployment procedure to allow Kyma to run and install smoothly on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. In addition, you will be able to add and configure Azure Broker in your cluster to enable easy provisioning and binding of Microsoft Azure services in your applications.</p>\n<p>Developers working with Lambdas will appreciate the possibility to test them directly from the UI. You will able to provide input data and see the value the function returns without exposing it through the API gateway.</p>\n<p>In 0.7 release, we also introduce the first version of the Asset Store which is a generic, Kubernetes-native solution that will store our documentation, images, API specifications, and client-side applications. It is an evolution of our current storage solution based on Minio.</p>\n<p>As in the previous release, we continue on improving the security of Kyma. The Dublin release will come with the first version of authorization in UI-API Layer (GraphQL), which is based on the proof of concept we worked on.</p>\n<p>You can also expect a couple of smaller improvements related to UI/UX, better UI tests, further refactoring for better modularization, and more.

The main focus of this release was to finalize the work on Prow and replace the existing CI pipeline with the new architecture. Thus, we are excited to announce that Kyma finally uses an open-source CI tool and that Kyma 0.6 Cairo was already built using the Prow architecture. Apart from Prow, we made efforts to drive the Kyma-Knative integration forward, took further steps to modularize Kyma components and unify their naming, and significantly improved the website-related user experience.</p>\n<p>Explore the changes, try out the release, and get back to us with feedback and contribution!</p>\n<!-- overview -->\n<p>The highlights of Kyma 0.6 Cairo include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#prow-in-kyma\">Prow in Kyma</a> - We implemented the new open-source CI tool in Kyma.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#installation-with-knative\">Installation with Knative</a> and <a href=\"#knative-adoption-first-steps\">Knative eventing integration</a> - We enabled Knative installation with Kyma and made first steps towards Knative eventing integration.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#remote-environment-renaming\">Remote Environment</a> and <a href=\"#environment-controller-renaming\">Environment Controller renaming</a> - As part of the naming unification scheme, we renamed Remote Environments to Applications and the Environment Controller to Namespace Controller.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#backend-modularization\">Console backend</a> and <a href=\"#modularization\">Service Catalog modularization</a> - We modularized the Console backend and the Service Catalog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#google-cloud-platform-service-broker\">Google Cloud Platform Service Broker</a> - We extended the Service Catalog with Google offerings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"#kyma-projectio\">kyma-project.io navigation improvements</a> - We improved navigation and readability of Docs on <code>kyma-project.io</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the overview of all changes in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#application-connector\">Application Connector</a> - Remote Environment renaming</li>\n<li><a href=\"#console\">Console</a> - Luigi framework on board, new navigation structure, backend modularization, AsyncApi rendering</li>\n<li><a href=\"#continuous-integration\">Continuous Integration</a> - Prow in Kyma</li>\n<li><a href=\"#eventing\">Eventing</a> - Knative adoption first steps</li>\n<li><a href=\"#installation\">Installation</a> - Environment Controller renaming, wildcard DNS <code>xip.io</code> integration, installation with Knative</li>\n<li><a href=\"#serverless\">Serverless</a> - Upgrade to Kubeless v1, function autoscaling</li>\n<li><a href=\"#service-catalog\">Service Catalog</a> - Google Cloud Platform Service Broker, modularization, new tooling for the Service Catalog UI tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"#kyma-project-io\">kyma-project.io</a> - Linking enabled, <code>master</code> branch available in Docs, blog landing page excerpts, improved styling of Docs, scrollspy in Docs.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Application Connector</h2>\n<h3>Remote Environment renaming</h3>\n<p>As a step towards having a consistent naming scheme for all Kyma components, we renamed Remote Environments to <strong>Applications</strong>. This way, the Application Connector finally connects Applications instead of Remote Environments. This change was introduced consistently across the whole Kyma, including Application Connector components and the Console UI.</p>\n<h2>Console</h2>\n<h3>Luigi framework on board</h3>\n<p>The Console UI was refactored and it now uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/luigi/blob/master/README.md\">Luigi</a> framework to orchestrate client-side micro frontends. With Luigi on board, the Console allows for secure and technology-agnostic UI extensibility in Kyma. </p>\n<h3>New navigation structure</h3>\n<p>The new navigation in the Console provides a more structured content. Immediately after you sign in, you can see all the Namespaces in the main content area. You also have all the cluster-wide information at hand in the left navigation panel. </p>\n<p><img src=\"./new-navigation-structure.png\"></p>\n<h3>Backend modularization</h3>\n<p>As you know, we want Kyma to be highly modular and allow you to skip the installation of components you don't need. For example, if you have your own Istio, you should be able to decide if you want to install the one Kyma provides. This requires some refactoring of the Console backend to ensure proper resiliency in the Console UI. In this release, we completed the modularization of the backend and hid it under the feature flag. The reason why it is not enabled by default is that the Console UI still requires resiliency improvements to ensure no errors occur when a certain Kyma component is not installed. The backend modularization was done based on <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/issues/165\">this</a> decision and the referenced proposal.</p>\n<p>To quickly switch the Console backend to work in the modular mode, run the following command in the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>kubectl set env deployment/core-ui-api MODULE_PLUGGABILITY=true -n kyma-system\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more details about the introduced changes, read the related <a href=\"/docs/0.6/components/console#details-ui-api-layer\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>AsyncApi rendering</h3>\n<p>We created a new component for rendering the <a href=\"https://www.asyncapi.com/\">AsyncApi specification</a>. It now fully supports the specification and improves its look and feel when compared to the very minimalistic table we had before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./asyncapi-rendering.png\"></p>\n<p>The other great thing we did in this area was creating the component in a very generic way in a separate repository, and donating it to the <a href=\"https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react\">AsyncApi organization</a>. This means we maintain it directly from the AsyncApi organization and you can use this component not only in Kyma.</p>\n<p>Feel free to play with it and give us your feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Read the related <a href=\"https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react#props\">documentation</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test the component <a href=\"https://www.asyncapi.com/asyncapi-react/\">playground</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customize the component quickly in the <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/5vz8l9zlmn\">sandbox project</a>.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>\n<h3>Prow in Kyma</h3>\n<p>After a few weeks of hard work, the Prow Working Group finalized our plan of having an open-source CI tool for Kyma. All Kyma repositories and components are now handled by Prow. We defined the release pipeline and already tested it when preparing this release.</p>\n<p>The important change that Prow introduces is that external contributors are now able to see build statuses on their pull requests. They can also check logs of all executed jobs. However, to (re)run the jobs on the pull requests, external contributors need to contact a Kyma organization member as, for security reasons, this functionality is available only to internal contributors.</p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra\"><code>test-infra</code></a> repository and read more about Prow and its setup in Kyma.</p>\n<h2>Eventing</h2>\n<h3>Knative adoption first steps</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Kyma eventing use cases</p>\n<p>To better align with the Knative eventing community, we created basic use cases of Kyma eventing. These use cases are meant to help us and the community to drive the Knative eventing evolution forward. Read more about the use cases <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/sig-and-wg/wg-knative/kyma-eventing-use-case.md\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kyma-Knative eventing installation design</p>\n<p>As an initial step towards adopting Knative eventing, we need to have a design that allows us to install Kyma eventing on top of Knative eventing. This way, it will be possible to use Knative eventing as the underlying layer in Kyma, and achieve pluggability. Read more about our plan in <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/issues/166\">this</a> proposal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<h3>Environment Controller renaming</h3>\n<p>The Environment Controller that injects limit ranges, resource quotas, and default roles into each Namespace you create, was renamed to <strong>Namespace Controller</strong>. Its logic, however, is still the same and the <code>env=true</code> label remains untouched. It is also worth mentioning that the Environment-to-Namespace renaming process is ongoing. As part of it, we have already renamed Environments to <strong>Namespaces</strong> in the Console UI.</p>\n<h3>Wildcard DNS xip.io integration</h3>\n<p>You can now test Kyma on a cluster with a wildcard DNS provided by <code>xip.io</code>. </p>\n<p>We introduced a new <code>xip-patch</code> job to Kyma as an optionally installed patch component. This patch issues a self-signed TLS certificate for the Kyma instance and configures the domain to <code>{LOADBALANCER_IP}.xip.io</code>, where <code>{LOADBALANCER_IP}</code> is the IP address of the assigned load balancer in the Kyma cluster. </p>\n<p>This feature allows you to install and use Kyma easier, without owning a domain or issuing the TLS certificate on your own. This solution is not suitable for a production environment. It is only a playground you can use to get to know the product better. Read more about this optional feature <a href=\"/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-a-gke-cluster-with-wildcard-dns\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Installation with Knative</h3>\n<p>You can now install Kyma together with Knative and expose APIs using the <code>knative-ingressgateway</code> service. Knative installation also enables future work on integrating Kyma eventing with Knative eventing.</p>\n<p>Find out how to <a href=\"/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-installation-with-knative\">install</a> Kyma with Knative.</p>\n<h2>Serverless</h2>\n<h3>Upgrade to Kubeless v1</h3>\n<p>Kyma now uses Kubeless v1, the first stable release of Kubeless. </p>\n<h3>Function autoscaling</h3>\n<p>Lambda functions use the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale the number of Pods based on CPU usage. To prevent any unexpected scaling, autoscaling was limited to the function type. We also created a frequently scheduled load test to validate the scaling behavior on Azure. </p>\n<p>The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is not enabled in your local Kyma installation by default, so you need to activate it manually. Read <a href=\"/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-the-release-enable-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-hpa-\">this</a> document to learn how to do that.</p>\n<h2>Service Catalog</h2>\n<h3>Google Cloud Platform Service Broker</h3>\n<p>Kyma provides the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Broker. Apart from the GCP standard integration offering, you can configure the GCP Broker for a specific GCP project in a given Kyma Namespace. Install the GCP Service Broker by provisioning the <strong>Google Cloud Platform Service Broker Provider</strong> class exposed by the Helm Broker. Read more about this new feature <a href=\"/docs/0.6/components/service-brokers#overview-google-cloud-platform-broker\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./gcp-provider-class.png\"></p>\n<h3>Modularization</h3>\n<p>We split the Kyma Service Catalog module into <code>service-catalog</code> and <code>service-catalog-addons</code>. The <code>service-catalog</code> module contains the core functionality and can be excluded from the Kyma installation if the Service Catalog is already installed on the cluster. The <code>service-catalog-addons</code> module contains all features built around the core, such as automatic bindings and the UI.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-installation-with-custom-service-catalog-deployment\">these</a> steps to install Kyma with a custom Service Catalog deployment.</p>\n<h3>New tooling for the Service Catalog UI tests</h3>\n<p>The Helm Broker Bundles repository supports the OSB API contract implemented by the Service Catalog v0.1.38. We released the testing bundle that allows you to perform end-to-end UI testing for the Service Catalog.</p>\n<p>Read more about the release details <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/releases\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>kyma-project.io</h2>\n<h3>Linking enabled</h3>\n<p>In the past, we kept postponing the implementation of linking between documents on the <code>kyma-project.io</code> website. As a result, you could see such a temporary solution in place:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./document-references.png\"></p>\n<p>In short, there was a simple but not very useful text reference to other documents. This was due to the fact that we couldn't support linking of documents on GitHub and <code>kyma-project.io</code> at the same time. We decided, however, to give the website documentation a priority and treat Markdown files on GitHub only as document sources. As for the documentation in the Console, linking between the documents allows you to stay in the Console without being redirected to the website's Docs.</p>\n<p>As a follow-up to this new improvement, we also added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/content-guidelines/links-in-docs.md\">Guidelines</a> for all contributors on how to add links to documents under <code>kyma/docs</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>chain link icon</strong> on <code>kyma-project.io</code> that allows you to remember the link to a given document section easier. When you hover the cursor over any heading in the documentation, you can now see this icon. Once you click it, the address bar in the browser gets updated with the direct link to a given section.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./linking.png\"></p>\n<h3>Master branch available in Docs</h3>\n<p>Since we introduced a website-centric approach to linking in the documentation, we wanted to make sure you don't fail at reading it on GitHub as a contributor, by being constantly redirected to the website's Docs. Before Kyma 0.6 Cairo, we only rendered the release-related documentation on <code>kyma-project.io/docs</code>. Now, as one of few open-source projects, we also render documentation for the <a href=\"https://kyma-project.io/docs/master\"><code>master</code></a> branch. This documentation is updated on the website automatically, approx. 10 minutes after every merge of changes to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we also render the documentation for pre-releases on <code>kyma-project.io/docs</code>, whenever they are available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./master-branch.png\"></p>\n<h3>Blog landing page excerpts </h3>\n<p>We started to render only condensed excerpts of the blog posts on the landing page. Thanks to this feature, the page isn't so overloaded with information and it's easier to scroll through the list of available posts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./excerpts.png\"></p>\n<p>We realize there are still some things to improve in this topic. We have already aggregated our plans for the blog section in <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/website/issues/142\">this</a> issue. These improvements are on our roadmap but haven't been scheduled for any particular milestone yet. Feel free to contact us if you want to contribute and improve the overall user experience in this area.</p>\n<h3>Improved styling of Docs</h3>\n<p>With a few new tweaks in the style of the Docs section, we improved its readability. The font size change, better spacing, and sections separation make the reading more pleasurable.</p>\n<p>Another important change is the width of the content container. It is now consistent with the GitHub UI, which significantly improves the contributor experience. All images and diagrams that you see in the pull request are the same in terms of width and size with what we render on <code>kyma-project.io</code> or in the documentation in the Console.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./styling.png\"></p>\n<h3>Scrollspy</h3>\n<p>As you have probably noticed from reading our documentation section on <code>kyma-project.io/docs</code>, we adhere to the rule of rendering the whole documentation for a given topic on one site. The downside of such an approach is that you get a lot of content on a single page and it is easy to get lost if you scroll too fast. This can be easily solved by the <strong>Scrollspy</strong> feature that we introduce in this release. This solution spies your location on the screen while scrolling. Thanks to this approach, the navigation panel is updated with the information on the document you are currently reading. When you scroll, we highlight the name of the document that you are reading at the moment.</p>\n<p>Scrollspy is available on <code>kyma-project.io/docs</code>  and in the Console documentation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./scrollspy.gif\"></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The 0.6 release brings a lot of significant changes to Kyma.

The main focus of this release was to finalize the work on Prow and replace the existing CI pipeline with the new architecture. Thus, we are excited to announce that Kyma finally uses an open-source CI tool and that Kyma 0.6 Cairo was already built using the Prow architecture. Apart from Prow, we made efforts to drive the Kyma-Knative integration forward, took further steps to modularize Kyma components and unify their naming, and significantly improved the website-related user experience.\n\nExplore the changes, try out the release, and get back to us with feedback and contribution!\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\nThe highlights of Kyma 0.6 Cairo include:\n\n- [Prow in Kyma](#prow-in-kyma) - We implemented the new open-source CI tool in Kyma.\n- [Installation with Knative](#installation-with-knative) and [Knative eventing integration](#knative-adoption-first-steps) - We enabled Knative installation with Kyma and made first steps towards Knative eventing integration.\n- [Remote Environment](#remote-environment-renaming) and [Environment Controller renaming](#environment-controller-renaming) - As part of the naming unification scheme, we renamed Remote Environments to Applications and the Environment Controller to Namespace Controller.\n- [Console backend](#backend-modularization) and [Service Catalog modularization](#modularization) - We modularized the Console backend and the Service Catalog.\n- [Google Cloud Platform Service Broker](#google-cloud-platform-service-broker) - We extended the Service Catalog with Google offerings.\n- [kyma-project.io navigation improvements](#kyma-projectio) - We improved navigation and readability of Docs on `kyma-project.io`.\n\nSee the overview of all changes in this release:\n\n- [Application Connector](#application-connector) - Remote Environment renaming\n- [Console](#console) - Luigi framework on board, new navigation structure, backend modularization, AsyncApi rendering\n- [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration) - Prow in Kyma\n- [Eventing](#eventing) - Knative adoption first steps\n- [Installation](#installation) - Environment Controller renaming, wildcard DNS `xip.io` integration, installation with Knative\n- [Serverless](#serverless) - Upgrade to Kubeless v1, function autoscaling\n- [Service Catalog](#service-catalog) - Google Cloud Platform Service Broker, modularization, new tooling for the Service Catalog UI tests\n- [kyma-project.io](#kyma-project-io) - Linking enabled, `master` branch available in Docs, blog landing page excerpts, improved styling of Docs, scrollspy in Docs.\n\n---\n\n\n## Application Connector\n\n### Remote Environment renaming\n\nAs a step towards having a consistent naming scheme for all Kyma components, we renamed Remote Environments to **Applications**. This way, the Application Connector finally connects Applications instead of Remote Environments. This change was introduced consistently across the whole Kyma, including Application Connector components and the Console UI.\n\n## Console\n\n### Luigi framework on board\n\nThe Console UI was refactored and it now uses the [Luigi](https://github.com/kyma-project/luigi/blob/master/README.md) framework to orchestrate client-side micro frontends. With Luigi on board, the Console allows for secure and technology-agnostic UI extensibility in Kyma. \n\n### New navigation structure\n\nThe new navigation in the Console provides a more structured content. Immediately after you sign in, you can see all the Namespaces in the main content area. You also have all the cluster-wide information at hand in the left navigation panel. \n\n![](./new-navigation-structure.png)\n\n### Backend modularization\n\nAs you know, we want Kyma to be highly modular and allow you to skip the installation of components you don't need. For example, if you have your own Istio, you should be able to decide if you want to install the one Kyma provides. This requires some refactoring of the Console backend to ensure proper resiliency in the Console UI. In this release, we completed the modularization of the backend and hid it under the feature flag. The reason why it is not enabled by default is that the Console UI still requires resiliency improvements to ensure no errors occur when a certain Kyma component is not installed. The backend modularization was done based on [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/issues/165) decision and the referenced proposal.\n\nTo quickly switch the Console backend to work in the modular mode, run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\nkubectl set env deployment/core-ui-api MODULE_PLUGGABILITY=true -n kyma-system\n```\n\nFor more details about the introduced changes, read the related [documentation](/docs/0.6/components/console#details-ui-api-layer).\n\n### AsyncApi rendering  \n\nWe created a new component for rendering the [AsyncApi specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/). It now fully supports the specification and improves its look and feel when compared to the very minimalistic table we had before.\n\n![](./asyncapi-rendering.png)\n\nThe other great thing we did in this area was creating the component in a very generic way in a separate repository, and donating it to the [AsyncApi organization](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react). This means we maintain it directly from the AsyncApi organization and you can use this component not only in Kyma.\n\nFeel free to play with it and give us your feedback:\n\n- Read the related [documentation](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react#props).\n\n- Test the component [playground](https://www.asyncapi.com/asyncapi-react/).\n\n- Customize the component quickly in the [sandbox project](https://codesandbox.io/s/5vz8l9zlmn).  \n\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\n### Prow in Kyma\n\nAfter a few weeks of hard work, the Prow Working Group finalized our plan of having an open-source CI tool for Kyma. All Kyma repositories and components are now handled by Prow. We defined the release pipeline and already tested it when preparing this release.\n\nThe important change that Prow introduces is that external contributors are now able to see build statuses on their pull requests. They can also check logs of all executed jobs. However, to (re)run the jobs on the pull requests, external contributors need to contact a Kyma organization member as, for security reasons, this functionality is available only to internal contributors.\n\nVisit our [`test-infra`](https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra) repository and read more about Prow and its setup in Kyma.\n\n\n## Eventing\n\n### Knative adoption first steps\n\n- Kyma eventing use cases\n\n  To better align with the Knative eventing community, we created basic use cases of Kyma eventing. These use cases are meant to help us and the community to drive the Knative eventing evolution forward. Read more about the use cases [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/sig-and-wg/wg-knative/kyma-eventing-use-case.md).\n\n- Kyma-Knative eventing installation design\n\n  As an initial step towards adopting Knative eventing, we need to have a design that allows us to install Kyma eventing on top of Knative eventing. This way, it will be possible to use Knative eventing as the underlying layer in Kyma, and achieve pluggability. Read more about our plan in [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/issues/166) proposal.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Controller renaming\n\nThe Environment Controller that injects limit ranges, resource quotas, and default roles into each Namespace you create, was renamed to **Namespace Controller**. Its logic, however, is still the same and the `env=true` label remains untouched. It is also worth mentioning that the Environment-to-Namespace renaming process is ongoing. As part of it, we have already renamed Environments to **Namespaces** in the Console UI.\n\n### Wildcard DNS xip.io integration\n\nYou can now test Kyma on a cluster with a wildcard DNS provided by `xip.io`. \n\nWe introduced a new `xip-patch` job to Kyma as an optionally installed patch component. This patch issues a self-signed TLS certificate for the Kyma instance and configures the domain to `{LOADBALANCER_IP}.xip.io`, where `{LOADBALANCER_IP}` is the IP address of the assigned load balancer in the Kyma cluster. \n\nThis feature allows you to install and use Kyma easier, without owning a domain or issuing the TLS certificate on your own. This solution is not suitable for a production environment. It is only a playground you can use to get to know the product better. Read more about this optional feature [here](/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-on-a-gke-cluster-with-wildcard-dns).\n\n### Installation with Knative\n\nYou can now install Kyma together with Knative and expose APIs using the `knative-ingressgateway` service. Knative installation also enables future work on integrating Kyma eventing with Knative eventing.\n\nFind out how to [install](/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-installation-with-knative) Kyma with Knative.\n\n\n## Serverless\n\n### Upgrade to Kubeless v1\n\nKyma now uses Kubeless v1, the first stable release of Kubeless. \n\n### Function autoscaling\n\nLambda functions use the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale the number of Pods based on CPU usage. To prevent any unexpected scaling, autoscaling was limited to the function type. We also created a frequently scheduled load test to validate the scaling behavior on Azure. \n\nThe Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is not enabled in your local Kyma installation by default, so you need to activate it manually. Read [this](/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-install-kyma-locally-from-the-release-enable-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-hpa-) document to learn how to do that.\n\n\n## Service Catalog\n\n### Google Cloud Platform Service Broker\n\nKyma provides the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Broker. Apart from the GCP standard integration offering, you can configure the GCP Broker for a specific GCP project in a given Kyma Namespace. Install the GCP Service Broker by provisioning the **Google Cloud Platform Service Broker Provider** class exposed by the Helm Broker. Read more about this new feature [here](/docs/0.6/components/service-brokers#overview-google-cloud-platform-broker).\n\n![](./gcp-provider-class.png)\n\n### Modularization\n\nWe split the Kyma Service Catalog module into `service-catalog` and `service-catalog-addons`. The `service-catalog` module contains the core functionality and can be excluded from the Kyma installation if the Service Catalog is already installed on the cluster. The `service-catalog-addons` module contains all features built around the core, such as automatic bindings and the UI.\n\nFollow [these](/docs/0.6/root/kyma#installation-installation-with-custom-service-catalog-deployment) steps to install Kyma with a custom Service Catalog deployment.\n\n### New tooling for the Service Catalog UI tests\n\nThe Helm Broker Bundles repository supports the OSB API contract implemented by the Service Catalog v0.1.38. We released the testing bundle that allows you to perform end-to-end UI testing for the Service Catalog.\n\nRead more about the release details [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/releases).\n\n## kyma-project.io\n\n### Linking enabled\n\nIn the past, we kept postponing the implementation of linking between documents on the `kyma-project.io` website. As a result, you could see such a temporary solution in place:\n\n![](./document-references.png)\n\nIn short, there was a simple but not very useful text reference to other documents. This was due to the fact that we couldn't support linking of documents on GitHub and `kyma-project.io` at the same time. We decided, however, to give the website documentation a priority and treat Markdown files on GitHub only as document sources. As for the documentation in the Console, linking between the documents allows you to stay in the Console without being redirected to the website's Docs.\n\nAs a follow-up to this new improvement, we also added:\n\n- [Guidelines](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/content-guidelines/links-in-docs.md) for all contributors on how to add links to documents under `kyma/docs`.\n\n- The **chain link icon** on `kyma-project.io` that allows you to remember the link to a given document section easier. When you hover the cursor over any heading in the documentation, you can now see this icon. Once you click it, the address bar in the browser gets updated with the direct link to a given section.\n\n![](./linking.png)\n\n### Master branch available in Docs\n\nSince we introduced a website-centric approach to linking in the documentation, we wanted to make sure you don't fail at reading it on GitHub as a contributor, by being constantly redirected to the website's Docs. Before Kyma 0.6 Cairo, we only rendered the release-related documentation on `kyma-project.io/docs`. Now, as one of few open-source projects, we also render documentation for the [`master`](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master) branch. This documentation is updated on the website automatically, approx. 10 minutes after every merge of changes to the `master` branch.\n\nThe good news is that we also render the documentation for pre-releases on `kyma-project.io/docs`, whenever they are available.\n\n![](./master-branch.png)\n\n### Blog landing page excerpts \n\nWe started to render only condensed excerpts of the blog posts on the landing page. Thanks to this feature, the page isn't so overloaded with information and it's easier to scroll through the list of available posts.\n\n![](./excerpts.png)\n\nWe realize there are still some things to improve in this topic. We have already aggregated our plans for the blog section in [this](https://github.com/kyma-project/website/issues/142) issue. These improvements are on our roadmap but haven't been scheduled for any particular milestone yet. Feel free to contact us if you want to contribute and improve the overall user experience in this area.\n\n### Improved styling of Docs\n\nWith a few new tweaks in the style of the Docs section, we improved its readability. The font size change, better spacing, and sections separation make the reading more pleasurable.\n\nAnother important change is the width of the content container. It is now consistent with the GitHub UI, which significantly improves the contributor experience. All images and diagrams that you see in the pull request are the same in terms of width and size with what we render on `kyma-project.io` or in the documentation in the Console.\n\n![](./styling.png)\n\n### Scrollspy\n\nAs you have probably noticed from reading our documentation section on `kyma-project.io/docs`, we adhere to the rule of rendering the whole documentation for a given topic on one site. The downside of such an approach is that you get a lot of content on a single page and it is easy to get lost if you scroll too fast. This can be easily solved by the **Scrollspy** feature that we introduce in this release. This solution spies your location on the screen while scrolling. Thanks to this approach, the navigation panel is updated with the information on the document you are currently reading. When you scroll, we highlight the name of the document that you are reading at the moment.\n\nScrollspy is available on `kyma-project.io/docs`  and in the Console documentation.\n\n![](./scrollspy.gif)\n","excerpt":"\nThe 0.6 release brings a lot of significant changes to Kyma.

Shortly after our last release, we now introduce the next update including many changes.</p>\n<!-- overview -->\n<h2>Application Connector</h2>\n<p>With the overall strategy to modularize Kyma as a whole, the Application Connector went through this change as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Application Connector has been modularized. All components have been moved to a separate Helm chart and are no longer a part of the Core. This also includes changes in the naming of the elements. The Gateway service has been renamed to the Proxy service.</li>\n<li>The Application Connector tests were extended with an additional flag for skipping SSL verification. It allows testing functionality against the Kyma cluster with a self-signed certificate.</li>\n<li>The Connector service now returns a client certificate as a full chain with a server-side certificate. The verification of a client certificate is now possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Serverless</h2>\n<p>Making use of serverless concepts and technologies is what makes Kyma so great. Hence, we made a number of improvements in this area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Lambda UI was extended with the option to set Environment Variable Prefixes for Service Bindings. This allows binding multiple services with the same set of environment variables.</li>\n<li>The Lambda UI was extended with the option to set JWK Authentication Properties. This allows defining specific Token Issuers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./jwks_authentication_1.png\"></p>\n<p>Authentication is enabled by default, and you can change JWKs URI using the <strong>Load Present</strong> option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./jwks_authentication2_2.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Lambda UI was extended with an alert informing you if you are about to leave the Lambda UI with unsaved changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./unsaved_changes_3.png\"></p>\n<h2>Service Catalog</h2>\n<p>We did a lot of great enhancements to the Kyma Service Catalog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Support for \"namespaced\" service catalogs. This means a possibility to register brokers for specific Namespaces only. The Catalog has an additional Brokers view in the Environment context. The view lists Service Brokers registered only for a given Namespace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/service-catalog#getting-started-getting-started\">Here</a> you can view a new getting started guide about brokers registration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/service-catalog#architecture-architecture\">Here</a> you can find an architecture diagram for the Namespace catalog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The instance list and details views now work on web-sockets. This significantly improves the user experience because all changes to the instance, and most important its status, are updated in real-time in the view without the need for a page refresh. If you are interested in how we managed to accomplish that on a GraphQL layer with Istio and token verification, feel free to contact us on <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/kyma-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAwNzE4Mjk2NDE3LTJhOTlmZjM5YzkwNmEzNmY3ZjE2MTU2OTMxOGE4ZDM0MmU4ZWRkZGJiODgzNmRmMTYxMDYwNjZiMDAwMTA2OWM\">Slack</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A completely new binding flow has been implemented in the instance view. Based on your feedback, we made sure it is far less complex than before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Names for resources are autogenerated.</li>\n<li>When binding to the application, you do not have to decide if you want to bind to Deployment first or maybe to the Function, as all applications are listed in one component for your convenience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./bind_application_1.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can set a proxy for instance environment variables that are injected to your application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./bind_application_3.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The status of credentials (ServiceBinding) and application binding (ServiceBindingUsage) is now visible. Even more, if you are viewing the bindings and in the meantime the credentials creation fails, the UI indicates the failure and adds a red marker on the tab. This way, you know something wrong happened and you need to check the tab.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./service_instances.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"./bound_applications.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The UI supports the ServiceBinding creation if the owner of the service class specified a custom schema for binding creation.</li>\n<li>The cleanup of resources got improved. When you decide to delete some Credentials, the related application bindings are also deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/service-brokers#configuration-configure-helm-broker\">Helm Broker</a> supports many bundle repositories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles\"><strong>bundles</strong></a> repository enables Kyma to install addons such as brokers, showcases and local services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It contains bundles which the Helm Broker uses. It allows you to choose a set of bundles and configure the Helm Broker. You can also define your own bundles.</li>\n<li>Have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md\">getting started document</a> which explains how to create your own bundles repository.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Eventing</h2>\n<p>As eventing is one of the core principles Kyma is built on, we enhanced the functionality further:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It is now possible for developers to change their subscriptions and fix any typos or wrong configurations. It allows avoiding a situation where, for example, specifying a wrong URL causes wrong Event type to be updated. Click <a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/event-bus#details-subscription-updates\">here</a> to see how this can be done.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A bug, which caused that it was impossible to create two subscriptions with same name in different Namespaces, has been fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kyma now enables a developer to understand better how to leverage tracing for handling problems in the Event flow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<p>There is a known intermittent Event trigger issue that causes the Events to not be delivered to lambdas or microservices.</p>\n<p>We are aware of this issue and we will provide a fix for it as part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/1687\">issue</a>.</p>\n<h4>Technical details</h4>\n<p>The issue lies in the subscription validator application. The application sometimes does not react when Kubernetes notifies it about creating new EventActivation instances.</p>\n<h4>Workaround</h4>\n<p>As a temporary fix for this issue, delete the sub-validator Pod by running the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get pods -l app=sub-validator -n kyma-system --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -n kyma-systemC\n</code></pre>\n<p>After deleting the sub-validator Pod, Kubernetes recreates it automatically, and the issue should be fixed.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>We constantly work on improving the security of Kyma:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation is now available on how to <a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/security#details-update-tls-certificate\">update TLS certificates</a>.</li>\n<li>The static user password for administrators is generated during installation and stored in the secret admin-user in the <code>kyma-system</code> Namespace. You can add further static users by providing your own Kubernetes secrets. Use this <a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/security#details-manage-static-users-in-dex\">link</a> to learn more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Service Mesh</h2>\n<p>Istio is now installed from official Istio charts. Istio customization was externalized into a separate component: <a href=\"/docs/0.5/components/service-mesh#details-istio-patch\">istio-patch</a>. As a result, Kyma can be installed on top of an existing <a href=\"/docs/0.5/root/kyma#installation-installation-with-custom-istio-deployment\">Istio installation</a> (in the supported version).</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>The installation documentation was reorganized and grouped under <a href=\"/docs/0.5/root/kyma#installation-installation\">Installation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\n<p>To keep track of your Kyma systems, we enhanced the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Alert is defined if an Pod is not restarting in one of the system Namespaces. This enables basic monitoring of the <code>kyma-system</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./alerts_9.png\"> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promehteus alerting webhooks are exposed in the configuration. This enables the integration of Prometheus alerting in custom dashboards.</li>\n<li>HTTP configuration now allows to define different ways of authentication in the face of the webhook. Basic auth, Tls and Baere token are some of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Known Issues</h3>\n<p>The Istio-related dashboards are not showing any data. For details, see <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/1724\">issue</a>.</p>\n<h4>Workaround </h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2>Logging</h2>\n<p>Kyma was extended with Persistence Layer for logging based on OK Log.</p>\n<h2>Tracing</h2>\n<p>The Tracing UI is now linked from within the Kyma Console UI to make it easier to access the tracing information.

Shortly after our last release, we now introduce the next update including many changes.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\n## Application Connector\n\nWith the overall strategy to modularize Kyma as a whole, the Application Connector went through this change as well:\n\n- The Application Connector has been modularized. All components have been moved to a separate Helm chart and are no longer a part of the Core. This also includes changes in the naming of the elements. The Gateway service has been renamed to the Proxy service.\n- The Application Connector tests were extended with an additional flag for skipping SSL verification. It allows testing functionality against the Kyma cluster with a self-signed certificate.\n- The Connector service now returns a client certificate as a full chain with a server-side certificate. The verification of a client certificate is now possible.\n\n## Serverless\n\nMaking use of serverless concepts and technologies is what makes Kyma so great. Hence, we made a number of improvements in this area:\n\n- The Lambda UI was extended with the option to set Environment Variable Prefixes for Service Bindings. This allows binding multiple services with the same set of environment variables.\n- The Lambda UI was extended with the option to set JWK Authentication Properties. This allows defining specific Token Issuers.\n\n![](./jwks_authentication_1.png)\n\nAuthentication is enabled by default, and you can change JWKs URI using the **Load Present** option.\n\n![](./jwks_authentication2_2.png)\n\n- The Lambda UI was extended with an alert informing you if you are about to leave the Lambda UI with unsaved changes.\n\n![](./unsaved_changes_3.png)\n\n## Service Catalog\n\nWe did a lot of great enhancements to the Kyma Service Catalog:\n\n- Support for &quot;namespaced&quot; service catalogs. This means a possibility to register brokers for specific Namespaces only. The Catalog has an additional Brokers view in the Environment context. The view lists Service Brokers registered only for a given Namespace.\n  - [Here](/docs/0.5/components/service-catalog#getting-started-getting-started) you can view a new getting started guide about brokers registration.\n  - [Here](/docs/0.5/components/service-catalog#architecture-architecture) you can find an architecture diagram for the Namespace catalog.\n  \n  - The instance list and details views now work on web-sockets. This significantly improves the user experience because all changes to the instance, and most important its status, are updated in real-time in the view without the need for a page refresh. If you are interested in how we managed to accomplish that on a GraphQL layer with Istio and token verification, feel free to contact us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kyma-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAwNzE4Mjk2NDE3LTJhOTlmZjM5YzkwNmEzNmY3ZjE2MTU2OTMxOGE4ZDM0MmU4ZWRkZGJiODgzNmRmMTYxMDYwNjZiMDAwMTA2OWM).\n\n- A completely new binding flow has been implemented in the instance view. Based on your feedback, we made sure it is far less complex than before:\n  - Names for resources are autogenerated.\n  - When binding to the application, you do not have to decide if you want to bind to Deployment first or maybe to the Function, as all applications are listed in one component for your convenience.\n  \n  ![](./bind_application_1.png)\n  \n  - You can set a proxy for instance environment variables that are injected to your application.\n  \n  ![](./bind_application_3.png)\n  \n  - The status of credentials (ServiceBinding) and application binding (ServiceBindingUsage) is now visible. Even more, if you are viewing the bindings and in the meantime the credentials creation fails, the UI indicates the failure and adds a red marker on the tab. This way, you know something wrong happened and you need to check the tab.\n  \n  ![](./service_instances.png)\n  \n  ![](./bound_applications.png)\n  \n  - The UI supports the ServiceBinding creation if the owner of the service class specified a custom schema for binding creation.\n  - The cleanup of resources got improved. When you decide to delete some Credentials, the related application bindings are also deleted.\n- [Helm Broker](/docs/0.5/components/service-brokers#configuration-configure-helm-broker) supports many bundle repositories.\n- The new [**bundles**](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles) repository enables Kyma to install addons such as brokers, showcases and local services.\n\n  - It contains bundles which the Helm Broker uses. It allows you to choose a set of bundles and configure the Helm Broker. You can also define your own bundles.\n  - Have a look at the [getting started document](https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) which explains how to create your own bundles repository.\n\n## Eventing\n\nAs eventing is one of the core principles Kyma is built on, we enhanced the functionality further:\n\n- It is now possible for developers to change their subscriptions and fix any typos or wrong configurations. It allows avoiding a situation where, for example, specifying a wrong URL causes wrong Event type to be updated. Click [here](/docs/0.5/components/event-bus#details-subscription-updates) to see how this can be done.\n\n- A bug, which caused that it was impossible to create two subscriptions with same name in different Namespaces, has been fixed.\n- Kyma now enables a developer to understand better how to leverage tracing for handling problems in the Event flow.\n\n### Known issues\n\nThere is a known intermittent Event trigger issue that causes the Events to not be delivered to lambdas or microservices.\n\nWe are aware of this issue and we will provide a fix for it as part of the [issue](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/1687).\n\n#### Technical details\n\nThe issue lies in the subscription validator application. The application sometimes does not react when Kubernetes notifies it about creating new EventActivation instances.\n\n#### Workaround\n\nAs a temporary fix for this issue, delete the sub-validator Pod by running the following command:\n\n```bash\n\n$ kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get pods -l app=sub-validator -n kyma-system --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -n kyma-systemC\n```\n\nAfter deleting the sub-validator Pod, Kubernetes recreates it automatically, and the issue should be fixed.\n\n## Security\n\nWe constantly work on improving the security of Kyma:\n\n- Documentation is now available on how to [update TLS certificates](/docs/0.5/components/security#details-update-tls-certificate).\n- The static user password for administrators is generated during installation and stored in the secret admin-user in the `kyma-system` Namespace. You can add further static users by providing your own Kubernetes secrets. Use this [link](/docs/0.5/components/security#details-manage-static-users-in-dex) to learn more.\n\n## Service Mesh\n\nIstio is now installed from official Istio charts. Istio customization was externalized into a separate component: [istio-patch](/docs/0.5/components/service-mesh#details-istio-patch). As a result, Kyma can be installed on top of an existing [Istio installation](/docs/0.5/root/kyma#installation-installation-with-custom-istio-deployment) (in the supported version).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe installation documentation was reorganized and grouped under [Installation](/docs/0.5/root/kyma#installation-installation).\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTo keep track of your Kyma systems, we enhanced the following:\n\n- An Alert is defined if an Pod is not restarting in one of the system Namespaces. This enables basic monitoring of the `kyma-system`.\n\n![](./alerts_9.png) \n\n- Promehteus alerting webhooks are exposed in the configuration. This enables the integration of Prometheus alerting in custom dashboards.\n- HTTP configuration now allows to define different ways of authentication in the face of the webhook. Basic auth, Tls and Baere token are some of them.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nThe Istio-related dashboards are not showing any data. For details, see [issue](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/1724).\n\n#### Workaround \n\nNone\n\n## Logging\n\nKyma was extended with Persistence Layer for logging based on OK Log.\n\n## Tracing\n\nThe Tracing UI is now linked from within the Kyma Console UI to make it easier to access the tracing information. Furthermore, it is now possible to compare two traces to track the process. You can get an answer to the question: &quot;Why did something unexpected happened?&quot; You can find more details [here](/docs/0.5/components/tracing#details-trace-comparison).\n\n## Console\n\n- You can extend the Console to add custom micro front-ends either for a single environment or for cluster-wide administration. More details can be found [here](/docs/0.5/components/console#details-ui-extensibility).\n\n![](./console_1.png) \n\n- It is now possible to view and edit **ConfigMaps**:\n\n![](./console_2.png) \n","excerpt":"\nWe constantly work improving Kyma and modularizing it further.

Many things have changed in the project since its <a href=\"/blog/introducing-project-kyma\">announcement</a> in July.\nNow that we have our first official release, it is time to sum up what we have recently worked on.</p>\n<!-- overview -->\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>In the area of security, we focused on our <a href=\"/docs/0.4/components/api-gateway\">API Gateway</a> that you can use to expose your API easily and in a secure way. We improved the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you create the <code>Api</code> kind, <code>hostname</code> is validated to make sure you provided the correct domain and that there are no duplicates.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/docs/0.4/components/api-gateway#architecture-architecture\">architecture</a> of the API Gateway component has changed. The services are now exposed by the Istio Gateway and the Istio Virtual Service, instead of the Istio Ingress.</li>\n<li>You can create several APIs for a single service in the Console UI by creating the API for a specific service in the <strong>Services</strong> view, or several different APIs from the <strong>APIs</strong> view.\n<img src=\"./multi-api.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Service Catalog</h2>\n<p>The Service Catalog, that is one of our key features, has undergone a lot of improvements over the last months, mainly thanks to your valuable feedback. To be more specific, the Console UI part of the Catalog was improved through the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The multi-step service provisioning wizard was replaced with a one-step wizard.</li>\n<li>You can preview the Instance's parameters by clicking the Instance's Plan name both on the list of all Service Instances and in the given Service Instance's details.\n<img src=\"./instance_params.png\"></li>\n<li>The Service Catalog's left navigation was removed and filtering is now available next to the search box. In its current form, it aims to support new filter options that will be introduced in the future. It also scales much better now when there are many values provided in the filters.\n<img src=\"./filter.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Console UI is not everything, however. These are further changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Catalog was upgraded to v0.1.34 that supports the Environment-wide resources (ServiceBroker, ServiceClass, ServicePlan). The related Console views do not support it yet.</li>\n<li>A new dashboard was provided in Grafana to improve Service Catalog-related operations.\n<img src=\"./sc_grafana_dashboard.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Application Connector</h2>\n<p>The Application Connector, that allows you to connect external systems with Kyma, underwent these major improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Management of the Remote Environments (RE) is no longer done through the Helm chart. Instead, we have a controller that reacts to changes in the RE and sets up the whole Environment.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/docs/0.4/components/application-connector#custom-resource-remoteenvironment\">RemoteEnvironments CRD</a> was enhanced with an extra label field. Now, you can mark the purpose of the Remote Environment in a flexible way.</li>\n<li>The OAuth token caching functionality was added to the Application Connector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Logging</h2>\n<p>Kyma has a new component to enhance its logging capabilities. This component is based on <a href=\"/docs/0.4/components/logging\">Logspout and OK Log</a>.</p>\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\n<p>Through the proper Grafana configuration, all dashboards created by you in the runtime are persistent, and Pods restarts do not remove them.</p>\n<h2>Event Bus</h2>\n<p>Our Kyma would not be so great without the support for the asynchronous communication between services. This is what we improved in that scope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We enabled an Event lifecycle for storing Events in a cluster. By default, it is set to 24h, but you can configure the lifecycle in the NATS Streaming's StatefulSet by changing the <code>max_age</code> value.</li>\n<li>We added the documentation for the service programming model for the Event subscribers. Read more <a href=\"/docs/0.4/components/event-bus#details-service-programming-model\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tracing</h2>\n<p>As you know, Kyma uses Jaeger as the tracing back-end. To improve its usage, we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secured the Jaeger UI so that you could access it easily without port-forwarding. Read more about <a href=\"/docs/0.4/components/tracing#overview-overview\">Jaeger</a>.</li>\n<li>Created an example on how to enable tracing for an application. Read more <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/master/tracing\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Service Mesh</h2>\n<p>At the moment, Kyma is using Istio <a href=\"https://istio.io/about/notes/1.0.1/\">1.0.1</a>.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>The following improvements were done in the installation area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/0.5-rc/docs/kyma/docs/032-inst-gke-installation.md\">Kyma installation on a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster</a> is now possible mainly due to the implementation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/0.4.1/components/apiserver-proxy\">API Server Proxy</a> component.</li>\n<li>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/0.5-rc/docs/kyma/docs/044-gs-installation-overrides.md\">override values in Helm charts</a> using config maps annotated with the <code>installer: overrides</code> label.</li>\n<li>The extended <a href=\"/docs/0.4/root/kyma#custom-resource-installation\"><code>Installation</code> custom resource</a> was enabled to allow you to provide a declarative list of modules that will be installed during the Kyma provisioning process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<p>A few weeks after the Kyma announcement, we published the official documentation on our <code>https://kyma-project.io/docs/</code> website. It is worth remembering, however, that this is not the only place where you can read the docs. Since the very beginning, the Kyma documentation has been an integral part of the Console UI, so whenever you provision a Kyma cluster, docs for a given Kyma version are always there for you.

Many things have changed in the project since its [announcement](/blog/introducing-project-kyma) in July.\nNow that we have our first official release, it is time to sum up what we have recently worked on.\n\n<!-- overview -->\n\n## Security\n\nIn the area of security, we focused on our [API Gateway](/docs/0.4/components/api-gateway) that you can use to expose your API easily and in a secure way. We improved the following things:\n* When you create the `Api` kind, `hostname` is validated to make sure you provided the correct domain and that there are no duplicates.\n* The [architecture](/docs/0.4/components/api-gateway#architecture-architecture) of the API Gateway component has changed. The services are now exposed by the Istio Gateway and the Istio Virtual Service, instead of the Istio Ingress.\n* You can create several APIs for a single service in the Console UI by creating the API for a specific service in the **Services** view, or several different APIs from the **APIs** view.\n![](./multi-api.png)\n\n\n## Service Catalog\n\nThe Service Catalog, that is one of our key features, has undergone a lot of improvements over the last months, mainly thanks to your valuable feedback. To be more specific, the Console UI part of the Catalog was improved through the following changes:\n- The multi-step service provisioning wizard was replaced with a one-step wizard.\n- You can preview the Instance's parameters by clicking the Instance's Plan name both on the list of all Service Instances and in the given Service Instance's details.\n![](./instance_params.png)\n- The Service Catalog's left navigation was removed and filtering is now available next to the search box. In its current form, it aims to support new filter options that will be introduced in the future. It also scales much better now when there are many values provided in the filters.\n![](./filter.png)\n\nThe Console UI is not everything, however. These are further changes:\n- The Catalog was upgraded to v0.1.34 that supports the Environment-wide resources (ServiceBroker, ServiceClass, ServicePlan). The related Console views do not support it yet.\n- A new dashboard was provided in Grafana to improve Service Catalog-related operations.\n![](./sc_grafana_dashboard.png)\n\n## Application Connector\n\nThe Application Connector, that allows you to connect external systems with Kyma, underwent these major improvements:\n- Management of the Remote Environments (RE) is no longer done through the Helm chart. Instead, we have a controller that reacts to changes in the RE and sets up the whole Environment.\n- The [RemoteEnvironments CRD](/docs/0.4/components/application-connector#custom-resource-remoteenvironment) was enhanced with an extra label field. Now, you can mark the purpose of the Remote Environment in a flexible way.\n- The OAuth token caching functionality was added to the Application Connector.\n\n## Logging\n\nKyma has a new component to enhance its logging capabilities. This component is based on [Logspout and OK Log](/docs/0.4/components/logging).\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThrough the proper Grafana configuration, all dashboards created by you in the runtime are persistent, and Pods restarts do not remove them.\n\n## Event Bus\n\nOur Kyma would not be so great without the support for the asynchronous communication between services. This is what we improved in that scope:\n- We enabled an Event lifecycle for storing Events in a cluster. By default, it is set to 24h, but you can configure the lifecycle in the NATS Streaming's StatefulSet by changing the `max_age` value.\n- We added the documentation for the service programming model for the Event subscribers. Read more [here](/docs/0.4/components/event-bus#details-service-programming-model).\n\n## Tracing\n\nAs you know, Kyma uses Jaeger as the tracing back-end. To improve its usage, we:\n- Secured the Jaeger UI so that you could access it easily without port-forwarding. Read more about [Jaeger](/docs/0.4/components/tracing#overview-overview).\n- Created an example on how to enable tracing for an application. Read more [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/master/tracing).\n\n## Service Mesh\n\nAt the moment, Kyma is using Istio [1.0.1](https://istio.io/about/notes/1.0.1/).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe following improvements were done in the installation area:\n- The [Kyma installation on a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/0.5-rc/docs/kyma/docs/032-inst-gke-installation.md) is now possible mainly due to the implementation of the [API Server Proxy](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/0.4.1/components/apiserver-proxy) component.\n- You can [override values in Helm charts](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/0.5-rc/docs/kyma/docs/044-gs-installation-overrides.md) using config maps annotated with the `installer: overrides` label.\n- The extended [`Installation ` custom resource](/docs/0.4/root/kyma#custom-resource-installation) was enabled to allow you to provide a declarative list of modules that will be installed during the Kyma provisioning process.\n\n## Documentation\n\nA few weeks after the Kyma announcement, we published the official documentation on our `https://kyma-project.io/docs/` website. It is worth remembering, however, that this is not the only place where you can read the docs. Since the very beginning, the Kyma documentation has been an integral part of the Console UI, so whenever you provision a Kyma cluster, docs for a given Kyma version are always there for you. In the last few months we have improved the following features in that area:\n- The [Kyma overview](/docs/0.4/root/kyma#overview-overview) documentation and many other sections, like consistency of the [Custom Resource reference](/docs/0.4/components/service-catalog#custom-resource-custom-resource) documents.\n- The general feel and look of the documentation, its navigation, consistency, and the readability of the content.\n![](./docs-ui.png)","excerpt":"\nIt has been a while since we introduced Kyma to the open-source community.

You can find us hanging around the SAP Cloud Platform booths and on the C/4HANA sessions we have on the agenda.\n\n- [For the Barcelona (23-25.Oct)](http://events.sap.com/teched-2018-emea/en/home) event the ambassadors are Marco Dorn ([@mado0803](https://twitter.com/mado0803)), Stanimir Ivanov ([@s1vanov](https://twitter.com/s1vanov)) and Lukasz Szymik ([@lszymik](https://twitter.com/lszymik)) who will also be available either at the SAP Cloud Platform booths or at the C/4HANA sessions they'll run.\n\n- Last but not least – for the [Bangalore (28-30.Nov)](http://events.sap.com/teched-2018-india/en/home) event we have Johannes Engelke ([@quablab](https://twitter.com/quablab)) and Sayan Hazra as the ambassadors. They'll make sure to spread the word about Kyma, and tell the attendees all about the extensibility of the product, and the Serverless functions.\n\nWe're super excited to see the Kyma story grow and more ideas come onboard. Feel free to meet all of the ambassadors and talk about Kyma and software extensibility, or any ideas you might have around these topics. The conversation might get you some cool merch as we might have some stickers to share with our lovely guests. Don't be shy! See you there!\n","excerpt":"\n[SAP TechEd](https://events.sap.com/teched/en/home) is the premier SAP technology conference, which takes place every year on 3 continents and is an excellent source of news on the technical and platform offerings of SAP.

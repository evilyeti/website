Kyma Service Mesh\nis based on [Istio](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html) open platform. The main principle of Kyma Service Mesh operation is the process of injecting Pods of every service with an Envoy - a sidecar proxy which intercepts the communication between the services and regulates it by applying and enforcing the rules you create. Kyma [Dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex), which is also a part of the Service Mesh, allows you to integrate any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)-compliant identity provider or a SAML2-based enterprise authentication server with your solution.\n\nSee this [Istio diagram](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/arch.svg) to understand the relationship between the Istio components and Services.\n"},{"order":"03-01-sidecar-proxy-injection","title":"Sidecar Proxy Injection","source":"\nBy default, the Istio sidecar injector watches all Pod creation operations on all Namespaces and injects the newly created Pods with a sidecar proxy.\n\nYou can disable sidecar proxy injection for either an entire Namespace or a single Deployment.\n\n* To disable sidecar proxy injection for a Namespace, set the **istio-injection** label value to `disabled` for the Namespace in which you want to disable the sidecar proxy injection. Use this command: `kubectl label namespace {YOUR_NAMESPACE} istio-injection=disabled`                                                                                                                                                                                \n* To disable sidecar proxy injection for a Deployment, add this annotation to the Deployment configuration file: `sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"false\"`\n\nRead the [Installing the Istio Sidecar](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection.html) document to learn more about sidecar proxy injection.\n","type":"Details"},{"order":"03-02-istio-patch","title":"Istio patch","source":"\nAs a core component, Istio installs with every Kyma deployment by default. The installation consists of two steps:\n\n1. Istio installs using the official, raw charts from the currently supported release. The charts that are currently\nused are stored in the `resources/istio` directory. The installation is customized by enabling security in Istio.\n\n>**NOTE:** Every installation of Istio for Kyma must have security enabled.\n\n2. A custom Istio patch is applied to further customize the Istio installation. A Kubernetes job introduces these changes:\n  - Sets a memory limit for every sidecar.\n  - Modifies Istio components to use Zipkin in the `kyma-system` Namespace, instead of the default `istio-system`.\n  - Adds a webhook to the Istio Pilot.\n  - Creates a TLS certificate for the Ingress Gateway.\n  - Deletes all resources related to the `prometheus`, `tracing`, `grafana`, and `servicegraph`charts.\n  - Enables sidecar injection in all Namespaces, except those labeled with `istio-injection: disabled`.\n\nTo learn more about the custom Istio patch applied in Kyma, see the `components/istio-kyma-patch/` directory.\n\n## Use an existing Istio installation with Kyma\n\nYou can use an existing installation of Istio running on Kubernetes with Kyma. The custom Istio patch is applied to such an installation.\n\n>**NOTE:** You cannot skip applying the Istio patch in the Kyma installation process.\n\nTo allow such implementation, you must install Kyma without Istio. Read [this](/docs/0.8/root/kyma#installation-custom-component-installation) document for more details.\n","type":"Details"}]},"navigation":{"topics":[{"id":"kyma","contentType":"root","sections":[{"topicType":"Overview","name":"Overview","anchor":"overview","titles":[{"name":"In a

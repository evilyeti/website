Feel free to meet all of the ambassadors and talk about Kyma and software extensibility, or any ideas you might have around these topics.

See you there!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 04, 2018","path":"/blog/blog-post-kyma-at-teched","title":"Kyma at SAP TechEd","author":"Krassimir Semerdzhiev, Kyma Open Source Strategist","tags":["kyma","ambassadors","event","extensibility","serverless","teched"]}}},"pageContext":{}}

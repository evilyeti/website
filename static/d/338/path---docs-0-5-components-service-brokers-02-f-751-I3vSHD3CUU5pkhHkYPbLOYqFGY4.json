A Service Broker manages the lifecycle of one or more services. It advertises a catalog of service offerings and service plans to a platform.\n\nThe Service Catalog lists all services that the Service Brokers offer. Use the Service Brokers to:\n* Provision and de-provision an instance of a service\n* Create and delete a service binding\n\nCreate a service binding to link a service instance to an application. During this process, credentials are delivered in Secrets to provide you with the information necessary to connect to the service instance. The process of deleting a service binding is known as unbinding.\n\nEach of the Service Brokers available in Kyma performs these operations in a different way. See the documentation for a given Service Broker to learn how it operates.\n\nKyma provides these Service Brokers to use with the Service Catalog:\n\n* Azure Broker\n* Remote Environment Broker\n* Helm Broker\n\nFollow the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md) specification to build your own Service Broker.\nRegister every new Service Broker in the Service Catalog to make the services and plans available to the users. For more information on registering Service Brokers in the Service Catalog, see the [Service Catalog Demonstration Walkthrough](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/docs/walkthrough.md).\n","type":"Overview"},{"order":"002-overview-azure-broker","title":"Azure Broker","source":"\nThe Microsoft Azure Broker is an open source, [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/)-compatible API server that provisions managed services in the Microsoft Azure public cloud.

A remote environment represents the environment connected to the Kyma instance. The Remote Environment Broker enables the integration of independent remote environments within Kyma. It also allows you to extend the functionality of existing systems.\n\nThe REB observes all the remote environment custom resources and exposes their APIs and/or Events as ServiceClasses to the Service Catalog. When the list of remote environments' ServiceClasses is available in the Service Catalog, you can create an EnvironmentMapping, provision those ServiceClasses, and enable them for Kyma services.\n\nThe REB implements the Service Broker API.

A bundle is an abstraction layer over a Helm chart which allows you to represent it as a ClusterServiceClass in the Service Catalog. For example, a bundle can provide plan definitions or binding details. The Helm Broker fetches bundle definitions from an HTTP server. By default, the Helm Broker fetches bundles from the [stable repository](https://kyma-project.github.io/bundles/stable/).\n\nThe Helm Broker implements the Service Broker API. For more information about the Service Brokers, see the **Service Brokers overview** document.\n","type":"Overview"},{"order":"011-configuration-helm-broker","title":"Configure Helm Broker","source":"\nThe Helm Broker fetches bundle definitions from an HTTP server defined in the `values.yaml` file. The **config.repository.URL** attribute defines the HTTP server URL.\n\n### Configuring the Helm Broker externally\n\nFollow these steps to change the configuration and make the Helm Broker fetch bundles from a custom HTTP server:\n\n1. Create a remote bundles repository. Your remote bundle repository must include the following resources:\n    - A `yaml` file which defines available bundles, for example `bundles.yaml`.\n      This file must have the following structure:\n\n      ```text\n      apiVersion: v1\n      entries:\n        {bundle_name}:\n          - name: {bundle_name}\n            description: {bundle_description}\n            version: {bundle_version}\n      ```\n      This is an example of a `yaml` file for the Redis bundle:\n      ```text\n      apiVersion: v1\n      entries:\n        redis:\n          - name: redis\n            description: Redis service\n            version: 0.0.1\n      ```\n\n    - A `{bundle_name}-{bundle_version}.tgz` file for each bundle version defined in the `yaml` file. The `.tgz` file is an archive of your bundle's directory.\n\n2. In the `values.yaml` provide your server's URLs in the **repository.URLs** attribute as a list of URLs separated by a semicolon:\n\n  ```yaml\n    repository:\n      URLs: \"http://custom.bundles-repository/bundles.yaml;http://another.bundles-repository/bundles.yaml\"\n  ```\n  > **NOTE:** You can skip the `yaml` filename in the URL if the name of the file is `index.yaml`. In that case, your URL should be equal to `http://custom.bundles-repository/`.\n\n3. Install Kyma on Minikube. See the **Install Kyma locally from the release** document to learn how.\n\n### Configure repository URLs in the runtime\n\nFollow these steps to add the repository URL:\n\n1. Add a new bundle repository URL:\n\n ```bash\n URLS=$(kubectl get -n kyma-system deployment/core-helm-broker --output=jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name==\"APP_REPOSITORY_URLS\")].value}')\n kubectl set env -n kyma-system deployment/core-helm-broker -e APP_REPOSITORY_URLS=\"$URLS;http://custom.bundles-repository/bundles.yaml\"\n ```\n\n2. Wait for the Helm Broker to run using the following command:\n\n ```bash\n kubectl get pod -n kyma-system -l app=core-helm-broker\n ```\n\nRunning the Helm Broker triggers the Service Catalog synchronization automatically. New ClusterServiceClasses appear after a half-minute.\n\n","type":"Configuration"},{"order":"012-configuration-helm-broker-bundles","title":"How to create a bundle","source":"\n[bind]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#binding  \"OSB Spec Binding\"\n[service-objects]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#service-object \"OSB Spec Service Objects\"\n[service-metadata]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/profile.md#service-metadata \"OSB Spec Service Metadata\"\n[plan-objects]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#plan-object \"OSB Spec Plan Objects\"\n\n\nTo create your own bundle, you must create a directory with the following structure:\n\n```\nsample-bundle/\n  ├── meta.yaml                             # A file which contains the metadata information about this bundle\n  ├── chart/                                # A directory which contains a Helm chart that installs your Kubernetes resources\n  │    └── <chart-name>/                    # A Helm chart directory\n  │         └── ....                        # Helm chart files\n  └── plans/                                # A directory which contains the possible plans for an installed chart\n       ├── example-enterprise               # A directory of files for a specific plan\n       │   ├── meta.yaml                    # A file which contains the metadata information about this plan\n       │   ├── bind.yaml                    # A file which contains information about the values that the Helm Broker returns when it receives the bind request\n       │   ├── create-instance-schema.json  # The JSON Schema definitions for creating a ServiceInstance\n       │   └── values.yaml                  # The default configuration values in this plan for a chart defined in the `chart` directory\n       └── ....\n```\n\n> **NOTE:** All the file names in the bundle directory are case-sensitive.\n\n\n### The bundle meta.yaml file\n\nThe `meta.yaml` file is mandatory as it contains information about the bundle. Set the following fields to create service objects which comply with the [Open Service Broker API][service-objects].\n\n|      Field Name     | Required |                                                                  Description                                                                           |\n|:-------------------:|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|         **name**        |   true   |                           The bundle name.

You must provide the image as an SVG.          |\n\n### The chart directory\n\nIn the mandatory `chart` directory, create a folder with the same name as your chart. Put all the files related to your chart in this folder. The system supports chart version 2.6.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the chart definitions, see the [Charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.6/docs/charts.md) specification.\n\n> **NOTE:** Helm Broker uses the [helm wait](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.6/docs/using_helm.md#helpful-options-for-installupgraderollback) option to ensure that all the resources that a chart creates are available. If you set your Deployment **replicas** to `1`, you must set **maxUnavailable** to `0` as a part of the rolling update strategy.\n\n### The plans directory\n\nThe mandatory `plans` directory must contain at least one plan.\nA directory for a specific plan must contain the `meta.yaml` file. Other files, such as `create-instance-schema.json`, `bind.yaml` and `values.yaml` are not mandatory.\n\n#### The meta.yaml file\n\nThe `meta.yaml` file contains information about a bundle plan. Set the following fields to create the plan objects, which comply with the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects].\n\n|  Field Name | Required |                                             Description                                                    |\n|:-----------:|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|     **name**    |   true   |     The plan name. It has the same restrictions as defined in the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects].    |\n|      **id**     |   true   |      The plan ID. It has the same restrictions as defined in the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects].     |\n| **description** |   true   | The plan description. It has the same restrictions as defined in the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects]. |\n| **displayName** |   true   | The plan display name. It has the same restrictions as defined in the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects]. |\n|  **bindable**   |   false  | The plan bindable attribute. It has the same restrictions as defined in the [Open Service Broker API][plan-objects].    |\n\n#### The bind.yaml file\n\nThe `bind.yaml` file contains the information required for the [binding action][bind] in a specific plan.\nIf you defined in the `meta.yaml` file that your plan is bindable, you must also create a `bind.yaml` file.\nFor more information about the content of the `bind.yaml` file, see the **Binding bundles** document.\n\n#### The values.yaml file\n\nThe `values.yaml` file provides the default configuration values in a concrete plan for the chart definition located in the `chart` directory.\nThis file is not required.\nFor more information about the content of the `values.yaml` file, see the [Values Files](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/release-2.6/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files.md) specification.\n\n#### The create-instance-schema.json file\n\nThe `create-instance-schema.json` file contains a schema used to define the parameters. Each input parameter is expressed as a property within a JSON object.\nThis file is not required.\nFor more information about the content of the `create-instance-schema.json` file, see the [Input parameters](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.14/spec.md#input-parameters-schema-object) specification.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nUse the dry-run mode to check the generated manifests of the chart without installing it.\nThe **--debug** option prints the generated manifests.\nAs a prerequisite, you must install [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) on your machine to run this command:\n\n```\n helm install --dry-run {path-to-chart} --debug\n```\nFor more details, read the Helm [official documentation](https://docs.helm.sh/chart_template_guide/#debugging-templates).\n","type":"Configuration"},{"order":"013-configuration-helm-broker-bundles-binding","title":"Binding bundles","source":"\n\n[bind]: https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.12/spec.md#binding  \"OSB Spec Binding\"\n\nIf you defined in the `meta.yaml` file that your plan is bindable, you must also create a `bind.yaml` file.\nThe `bind.yaml` file supports the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) binding concept. The `bind.yaml` file contains information the system uses in the [binding process][bind].\nThe `bind.yaml` file is mandatory for all bindable plans. Currently, Kyma supports only the [credentials](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#types-of-binding)-type binding.   \n\n\n>**NOTE:** Resolving the values from the `bind.yaml` file is a post-provision action. If this operation ends with an error, the provisioning also fails.\n\n## Details\n\nThis section provides an example of the `bind.yaml` file. It further describes the templating, the policy concerning credential name conflicts, and the detailed `bind.yaml` file specification.\n\n### Example usage\n\n```yaml\n# bind.yaml\ncredential:\n  - name: HOST\n    value: redis.svc.cluster.local\n  - name: PORT\n    valueFrom:\n      serviceRef:\n        name: redis-svc\n        jsonpath: '{ .spec.ports[?(@.name==\"redis\")].port }'\n  - name: REDIS_PASSWORD\n    valueFrom:\n      secretKeyRef:\n        name: redis-secrets\n        key: redis-password\n\ncredentialFrom:\n  - configMapRef:\n    name: redis-config\n  - secretRef:\n    name: redis-v2-secrets\n```\n\nIn this example of the [binding action][bind], the Helm Broker returns the following values:\n- A `HOST` key with the defined inlined value.\n- A `PORT` key with the value from the field specified by the JSONPath expressions. The `redis-svc` Service runs this expression.\n- A `REDIS_PASSWORD` key with a value selected by the `redis-password` key from the `redis-secrets` Secret.\n- All the key-value pairs fetched from the `redis-config` ConfigMap.\n- All the key-value pairs fetched from the `redis-v2-secrets` Secrets.\n\n### Templating\n\nIn the `bind.yaml` file, you can use the Helm Chart templates directives.\n\n```yaml\n# bind.yaml\ncredential:\n  - name: HOST\n    value: {{ template \"redis.fullname\" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local\n{{- if .Values.usePassword }}\n  - name: REDIS_PASSWORD\n    valueFrom:\n      secretKeyRef:\n        name: {{ template \"redis.fullname\" . }}\n        key: redis-password\n{{- end }}\n```\nIn this example, the system renders the `bind.yaml` file. The system resolves all the directives enclosed in the double curly braces in the same way as in the files located in the `templates` directory in your Helm chart.\n\n### Credential name conflicts policy\n\nThe following rules apply in cases of credential name conflicts:\n- When the `credential` and the `credentialFrom` sections have duplicate values, the system uses the values from the `credential` section.\n- When you duplicate a key in the `credential` section, an error appears and informs you about the name of the key that the conflict refers to.\n- When a key exists in the multiple sources defined by the `credentialFrom` section, the value associated with the last source takes precedence.\n\n### File specification\n\n|   Field Name   |                                                                                                                              Description                                                                                                                              |\n|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|   [credential](#configuration-binding-bundles-credential)   |                                                                                                         The list of the credential variables to return during the binding action.                                                                                                        |\n| [credentialFrom](#configuration-binding-bundles-credentialfrom) | The list of the sources to populate the credential variables on the binding action.

The Remote Environment Broker watches for RemoteEnvironments (REs) in the cluster and EnvironmentMappings (EMs) in all Namespaces.\n2. The user creates an EnvironmentMapping custom resource in a given Environment. The EnvironmentMapping activates services offered by a RE. The EnvironmentMapping must have the same name as the RE.\n3. The Remote Environment Broker creates a `remote-env-broker` Service Broker (SB) inside the Environment in which the EnvironmentMapping is created. This Service Broker contains data of all services provided by the activated RemoteEnvironments. There is always only one `remote-env-broker` Service Broker per Environment, even if there are more EnvironmentMappings.\n4. The Service Catalog fetches services that the `remote-env-broker` Service Broker exposes.\n5. The Service Catalog creates a ServiceClass for each service received from the Service Broker.\n\n![REB architecture](assets/001-REB-architecture.svg)\n\nWhen this process is complete, you can provision and bind your services.\n\n### Provisioning and binding for an API ServiceClass\n\nThis ServiceClass has a **bindable** flag set to `true` which means that you have to provision a ServiceInstance and bind it to the service or lambda to connect to the given API. The provisioning and binding workflow for an API ServiceClass consists of the following steps:\n1. Select a given API ServiceClass from the Service Catalog.\n2. Provision this ServiceClass by creating its ServiceInstance in the given Environment.\n3. Bind your ServiceInstance to the service or lambda. During the binding process, ServiceBinding and ServiceBindingUsage resources are created.\n    * ServiceBinding contains a Secret with a GatewayURL needed to connect to the given API.\n    * ServiceBindingUsage injects the Secret, together with the label given during the registration process, to the lambda or service.\n4. The service or lambda calls the API through the Application Connector. The Application Connector verifies the label to check if you have the authorization to access this API.\n5. After verifying the label, the Application Connector allows you to access the remote environment API.\n\n![API Service Class](assets/003-REB-API-service-class.png)\n\n### Provisioning and binding for an Event ServiceClass\n\nThis ServiceClass has a **bindable** flag set to `false` which means that after provisioning a ServiceClass in the Environment, given Events are ready to use for all services. The provisioning workflow for an Event ServiceClass consists of the following steps:\n1. Select a given Event ServiceClass from the Service Catalog.\n2. Provision this ServiceClass by creating a ServiceInstance in the given Environment.\n3. During the provisioning process, the EventActivation resource is created together with the ServiceInstance. EventActivation allows you to create an Event Bus Subscription.\n4. A Subscription is a custom resource by which an Event Bus triggers the lambda for a particular type of Event in this step.\n5. The RemoteEnvironment sends an Event to the Application Connector.\n6. The Application Connector sends an Event to the lambda through the Event Bus.\n\n\n![Event Service Class](assets/004-REB-event-service-class.png)\n\n### Provisioning and binding for both the API and Event ServiceClass\n\nThis ServiceClass has a **bindable** flag set to `true`.\nThe provisioning and binding workflow for both the API and Event ServiceClass is a combination of steps described for an [API ServiceClass](#architecture-the-remote-environment-broker-architecture-provisioning-and-binding-for-an-api-serviceclass) and an [Event ServiceClass](#architecture-the-remote-environment-broker-architecture-provisioning-and-binding-for-an-event-serviceclass).\n","type":"Architecture"},{"order":"021-architecture-helm-broker","title":"Helm Broker architecture","source":"\nThe Helm Broker workflow starts with the registration process, during which the Helm Broker fetches bundles from the Kyma `bundles` directory, or from a remote HTTP server.\n\n### Registration process\n\nThe registration process in case of the Helm Broker consists of the following steps:\n1.
